This chapter analyses a series of legal tools that target firm may use to fight off hostile takeover bids. Adopting a multi-case approach, the chapter focuses on life sciences industry example of target companies that have successfully thwarted hostile bids by using legal and managerial tools such as poison pills and the creation of staggered boards. The chapter also assesses the impact of the so-called crown jewel and white knight/white squire defence mechanisms. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Mark Thomas and Janna L.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of stock price crash risk on the adoption of poison pills. Design/methodology/approach: The authors estimate logit and probit regressions. Their sample includes 185 Brazilian public firms for the period 2010–2018. Following previous studies, the authors use the negative skewness of firm-specific weekly returns and the down-to-up volatility of firm-specific weekly returns as measures of firm's stock price crash risk. As proxies of poison pills, the authors employ the “conventional” poison pills in their baseline models and the “eternity” poison pills, which prevent the removal of poison pills from bylaws, in additional models. Findings: The authors find that stock price crash risk measures are not associated with poison pill adoption. However, although stock price crash risk does not lead to poison pill adoption as a complementary corporate governance mechanism that protects firms against hostile takeover attempts, further results show that managers do not draw on stock price crash risk as a pretext to entrench themselves. Additional analyses also highlight that CEO power seems to play a role in moderating the relationship between stock price crash risk and eternity poison pill adoption. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the literature on stock price crash risk, which calls for research in international contexts to better understand the effect of stock price crash risk on country-specific idiosyncratic features. The authors discuss a controversial anti-takeover mechanism that has been debated by Brazilian policymakers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We address the problem by studying U.S. states’ staggered adoption of poison pill laws (PPLs), which strengthen the right to adopt a pill (i.e., the shadow pill) and increase the validity of visible pills. We document that PPLs make visible pill policy aligned with economic incentives, increasing pill adoption among firms with a high likelihood of takeover, but decreasing it among firms with low takeover likelihood. We also document that PPLs positively impact firm value, especially for innovative firms with more intangible assets. © The Author(s), 2025.},

Our results show that firms facing hostile takeover threats increase investment in ESG initiatives. The positive association between hostile takeover threats and firms’ ESG investments is stronger for firms domiciled in states with expanded constituency statutes and for firms with fewer antitakeover provisions. Quasi-natural experiments based on the adoption of poison pill statutes further show that firms domiciled in states with such laws tend to exhibit lower levels of ESG investment after (vs. before) the passage of the statutes. In addition, we find that the probability of receiving hostile bids in a given year is lower for firms that increased their ESG investment in previous years, especially firms with a strong threat of ex-ante hostile takeover. Taken together, our findings suggest that firms use ESG investments as an important antitakeover device and that the threat of corporate hostile takeover has unintended effects on firms’ ESG investment and ethical business practices. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Case overview/synopsis: The case study is about the dilemma faced by Prantik Sinha, co-founder and director of Indian company AIPL, to accept or decline a JV offer from a French industrial conglomerate Serge Ferrari Group SA (SFG). AIPL is a leading manufacturer and trader of biogas storage tanks, water storage tanks, airlifting bags, floating boom barriers, trash floating boom barriers and inflatable swimming pools. The company adopts business-to-business and direct-to-customer business models. It develops products as per clients’ specifications and their exact requirements. In 2022, SFG proposed collaborating with AIPL to market its biogas digesters in India and abroad. As per the partnership deal, AIPL needed to split its biogas digester portfolio and sell it to the proposed JV for a specific one-time value. Sinha believed that the JV was an opportunity to scale the business globally and would likely shape the company’s future. However, he was in a quandary about making a final decision on accepting the JV offer because biogas digesters remained the company’s highest revenue-generating product portfolio. It was against this backdrop, what would Sinha do to accomplish his business objective and protect the interest of the company? The case study highlights Sinha’s commitment to nurture and expand AIPL’s business in India and beyond. It provides ample scope for students to analyze the pros and cons of AIPL’s JV initiative with SFG and suggest whether the company can leverage this offer for business growth.

We find that classified boards, poison pills, limits to amend bylaws, and fair price amendments are associated with significantly greater pollution. In contrast, cumulative voting, because it allows a greater voice for minority shareholders, is associated with lower pollution. We create a pollution-based index (the P-index) based on the sum of those governance provisions positively related to pollution plus an indicator for lack of cumulative voting. The P-index has approximately twice as large an association with firm-level pollution as the E-index. Most measures of board structure or compensation have no significant relation with pollution after controlling for the P-index. An instrumental variable analysis suggests a causal relation between the P-index and pollution. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The permissiveness of corporate defensive measures has been debated since their inception in the mid-1900s. Courts, scholars, and practitioners have grappled with the costs and benefits of these measures to both shareholders and society at large-and for good reason. On one hand, scholars and practitioners argue that defensive measures erode shareholder value by entrenching management, while on the other hand, supporters view defensive measures as valuable tools that allow target boards to appropriately defend against inadequate takeover bids. Delaware courts have confronted this debate in an interesting manner, initially viewing defensive measures as permissible under the business judgment rule, and later assessing them with enhanced scrutiny. But the Delaware courts have never considered defensive measures from a value perspective-or considered that certain defensive measures that depress ESG ratings-thus firm value-may warrant additional judicial scrutiny. This Comment begins from the premise that higher ESG ratings are indicative of greater long-term firm value. As supported by empirical studies conducted over the last decade, the combination of a poison pill and staggered board reduces ESG ratings, and thus reduces long-term firm value. Therefore, this Comment contends that the combination of these measures-the cornerstone of a "just say no" defense-should be assessed with enhanced scrutiny by Delaware courts. These defensive measures must survive heightened review at the "compelling justification" level. If the defensive measures do not survive this heightened standard of review, they must be viewed as an impermissible depression of shareholder value and dilution of shareholder rights. © 2023 University of Pennsylvania Law School.
