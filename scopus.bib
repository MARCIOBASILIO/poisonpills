	abstract = {Purpose: The authors study the shareholder wealth effects of the adoption and subsequent litigation confirming the validity of shareholder right plans that are enacted to protect a firm’s net operating loss (NOL) carry forwards (tax benefit preservation plans (TBPPs)). The purpose of this paper is to expand the understanding of nontraditional shareholder rights plans, which are becoming increasingly more common. Design/methodology/approach: This paper considers abnormal returns around TBPP adoptions and Delaware Court rulings that validated their use. The authors study 118 plans adopted between 1998 and 2011. Abnormal returns are measured using both a market model and a performance-matched sample. Findings: The authors find that abnormal returns are negative at the announcement of a new TBPP. However, the full impact of plan adoption on share prices is not evident until the Delaware Courts validated their use. The Delaware Court rulings in the case of Selectica, Inc. v. Versata Enterprises, Inc. and Trilogy, Inc. are associated with additional negative wealth effects for both prior plan adopters and the firms most likely to consider adopting a plan. These results suggest that entrenchment concerns tend to outweigh the protection of NOL carry forwards when firms adopt TBPPs. Originality/value: This study was the first to consider the adoption of TBPPs. Currently, it is the only study that considers Delaware Court rulings related to these plans, which allows us to successfully disentangle the entrenchment hypothesis from the potential alternative hypothesis that the negative announcement period returns are driven by investors updating their expectations for firm performance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The recent rise in counterfeits has now extended from basic consumer goods and electronics to pharmaceuticals, jeopardizing the health of millions across the globe. Estimates suggest that the counterfeit industry is now $75 billion and will grow by 20 % per year, making it one of the fastest growing public health risks [Poison pills. The Economist. 2012]. Counterfeit medications, comprising more than 30 % of medications in parts of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, have only recently gained recognition by the general public and mainstream media. Although the burden of disease lies largely with the world’s most vulnerable populations, Western countries are not insulated from this problem [The deadly world of fake drugs, Washington, DC]. With the rapid growth of online pharmacies, the currently quoted 1 % prevalence of counterfeit medications in the United States will quickly rise [World Health Organization, IMPACT. Counterfeit drugs kill! 2008]. The Internet, which boasts up to 50 % prevalence of counterfeit pharmaceuticals, has introduced medications such as blood pressure control, lifestyle medications, and pain modulators to the list of counterfeited medications. The traditional definition of counterfeit medications, including both generic and brand name, is medications deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled with respect to identity and/or source [Counterfeit medical products: report by the secretariat. Geneva]. In some instances, counterfeiting involves manufacturing a drug without its active ingredient-with chalk, starch, flour, or talcum powder in place of any active compound. Although less harmful than some of the more menacing manufacturing techniques, this approach puts patients at risk of morbidity and mortality from otherwise treatable diseases. In a more sinister approach, these formulations can be made with substitute medications providing relief of symptoms but not treatment of disease, for example, filling an antimalarial with acetaminophen, which will lower the fever of malaria but will not treat the underlying parasite. Other medications may have active ingredients but at nontherapeutic doses. This “up marketing” of medications runs the risk of creating resistance in the partially treated host. These substandard medications subject patients to treatment failures and create drug-resistant organisms. Lastly, and perhaps the most publicized aspect of this issue, is the inclusion of noxious chemicals in medications marketed as therapeutic pharmaceuticals. Most notoriously, in place of the glycerin normally used in cough syrup, the toxic substance diethylene glycol has been used because of its similar taste, color, consistency, and lower cost. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals thus have significant public health consequences beyond their individual-level effects. These falsified medications jeopardize the primary care environment by undermining people’s faith in their physicians and making them question the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain. This chapter will provide an overview of drug counterfeiting globally, describe its potential impact for urbanization and health, and discuss various mechanisms to address this problem. © Springer New York 2015.},

We first examine whether governance arrangements matter for overall firm reputation and then begin to address the question of how and why they might matter by exploring a number of different contingencies. We investigate these issues by considering how poison pills impacted the overall reputation of large corporations from 1985- 1989, the time period when this practice gained prominence. Our results show that poison pills did indeed negatively affect the overall reputation of firms even after controlling for various measures of financial performance. In addition, we find that assessments of firm reputation differed somewhat depending on the characteristics of the firm (i.e., its relative visibility) and upon the reputation granting audience (executives vs. analysts). We also find evidence of temporal differences in this relationship and show that over time, the evaluations of different groups converged around a negative view of firms with poison pills. Our results suggest that corporate governance has implications for perceptions of the broader well being of the firm, beyond the more narrow definitions of financial performance that are typically the focus of empirical research in the governance literature.},

In addition, the probability that a spinoff unit adopts a poison pill is negatively related to outside block ownership, but positively related to the size of the unit, institutional ownership, industry takeover activities, and relative industry market-to-book ratio. Units that adopted poison pills elicit a strong negative market response at the time of the spinoff, which implies that investors may believe the pills could prevent the units from being acquired. Despite the initial negative market response, abnormal long-run returns are higher among units that implement poison pills before the spinoff is executed than among units that do not. Moreover, we find that the units' adoption of poison pills does not reduce their likelihood of being acquired, which suggests that the pills may be intended to increase bargaining power rather than prevent takeovers, and could explain the more favorable long-run abnormal returns. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Japan's experience should have been a ringing endorsement for the utility of American corporate governance solutions in foreign jurisdictions-but it was not to be. Japan's unique interpretation of the “poison pill” that was so eagerly adopted by Japanese companies in the mid-to-late 2000s has turned out to be nothing like their potent American namesakes-and, in fact, the opposite of what would be expected by leading U.S. academics who have built a cottage industry publishing on the U.S. poison pill. © 2020 University of Pennsylvania Law School.

	abstract = {Congressional preemption constitutes perhaps the single greatest threat to state power and to the values served thereby. Given the structural incentives now in place, there is little to deter Congress from preempting state law, even when the state interests Congress displaces far exceed its own. The threat of preemption has raised alarms across the political spectrum, but no one has yet devised a satisfactory way to balance state and federal interests in preemption disputes. This Article devises a novel solution: state poison pill legislation. Borrowing a page from corporate law, poison pill legislation would enable the states to make preemption less palatable, by threatening to withhold valuable state services from Congress if Congress preempts state law. In more abstract terms, the Article re-imagines preemption as an as-yet untapped opportunity for intergovernmental bargaining, one in which poison pill legislation would facilitate beneficial trades between the state and federal governments over their respective constitutional entitlements. The Article explains how poison pill legislation would work, drawing upon a diverse array of case studies to illustrate the many potential applications of the tactic. It also proffers a normative defense of poison pill legislation, arguing that the tactic should produce better preemption decisions, from a welfarist perspective, without usurping Congress's legislative prerogatives-A problem endemic to extant solutions like the presumption against preemption. Finally, the Article lays the foundation for future work examining the use of threats to influence other legal decisions apart from preemption.},

	abstract = {Corporate law largely addresses three basic relationships: shareholder versus manager, shareholder versus non-equity investor, and majority shareholder versus minority shareholder. Ever since the pioneering work of Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means, a great deal of scholarly attention has been directed toward the first relationship. The second relationship earned its share of the limelight with the leveraged buyout trend of the 1980s. It is only in this decade, however, that the third relationship has taken center stage-in the wake of several incongruous Delaware cases and a flood of post-Sarbanes-Oxley freezeout mergers. This scrutiny is certainly warranted, as the tension between majority and minority shareholders presents thorny concerns and has the potential to erode considerable social welfare. In essence, lawmakers must walk a tightrope between two alternative hazards. On the one hand, assigning too much power to minority shareholders can lead to a holdout problem where recalcitrant dissenters demand private tribute before blessing a decision (such as a merger). On the other hand, granting the majority untrammeled discretion to freeze out minority owners can promote tunneling or other abuses of power that will depress the ex ante value of a firm. Thus far, the law has addressed these concerns with disclosure obligations, special committees, judicial review of fiduciary duties, and appraisal rights. But the results are far from satisfying. This Article offers a novel idea for governing the tension between majority and minority shareholders: an "internal poison pill." Borrowing conceptually from the famous shareholder rights plans created in the 1980s to address bullying external bidders, I show how an analogous (though economically distinct) financial instrument might be used by shareholders to navigate the twin internal governance tensions of holdout and expropriation. Two key features of this proposal distinguish it from alternative reforms: (1) It focuses on a privately enacted solution with room for contextual customization; and (2) it uses embedded option theory to construct an intermediate legal entitlement (as opposed to an extreme property or liability rule) for both majority and minority shareholders. It successfully scoped and swallowed, these internal poison pills could facilitate efficient freezeouts, chill coercive ones, supplant the awkward remedy of appraisal, and, ultimately, increase the ex ante value of firms by mitigating agency problems between majority and minority shareholders.

	abstract = {Following the first demerger of one of its divisions in the United States in 1995, US Industries, the Hanson conglomerate used the experience of this successful spin-off in preparation for its much larger and complete break-up planned for 1996, into four companies: Hanson, Energy, Imperial Tobacco and Millennium Chemicals. Part Two of this article investigates legal ways of demerging in the UK, and considers aspects of the 1995 USI demerger, which already showed some of the legendary Hanson skill in the management of restructuring. In the run-up to the 1996 demerger, the article looks at all the strategic and management skills that Hanson brought to the demerger operation to strengthen the companies' exit from the conglomerate. These were certainly needed since, as Part One of this article showed, the conglomerate had many weaknesses, which had developed since the late 1980s and which had not gone unnoticed by the stock market. The tactics used by Hanson included an active disposals programme, the reallocation of net debt among the companies and bank funding for them, minimisation of capital gains and income tax, and redemption of part of the conglomerate's bond holdings, a poison pill, and reductions in dividend payouts. A sample of broker valuations, made in early 1996, is observed, where sum-of-the-parts valuations were used. These are compared to actual share trading performance between October 1996 and January 1997, and the divergence examined. Academic evidence on the share performance of spin-offs in the US is considered. Finally, the article examines whether Hanson's and its demerged companies' shares were justifiably over-or under-valued in the three months following the demerger and flotation. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {The merger mania of the 1980s put top corporate management on the defensive as predators sought takeover targets. Hostile takeover activity has dissipated in recent years, for a variety of reasons, but the ethical issues surrounding acquisitions and mergers and the ethically questionable conduct that is often involved remain as relevant as ever. Most ethical discussions of acquisitions and mergers focus on the ethical conduct of the predator. The ethical conduct of the target company's top management is often overlooked. This chapter reviews the ethical literature on hostile takeovers and applies ethical theory to some of the defensive tactics that have been used to thwart unwanted takeovers. The focus will be on the fiduciary duties of top management and ethical issues involved with poison pills, greenmail, golden parachutes and other defensive tactics. Both utilitarian and nonutilitarian approaches will be used as tools of analysis. It also reviews the attitude toward the market for corporate control that exists in 17 transition economies. There is much evidence to suggest that most acquisitions and mergers result in a net benefit to the economy (Easterbrook and Fischel 1981; Ginsburg and Robinson 1986; Halpern 1973; Jensen and Ruback 1983, 1985, 1988). There are more winners than losers. Economists would say that it is a positive-sum game. Yet those who initiate such activity, the predators,' are commonly viewed as greedy, immoral, and uncaring. © 2009 Springer US.},

Proponents have predicted that disclosing a news event immediately after it arises could reduce information aggregation and disclosure bunching. But evidence from the theoretical literature suggests that the effect depends on whether managers can time the underlying required reporting event. Managers, for example, can time regular poison pill adoptions, but have limited ability to time in-play pill adoptions. Thus, I test whether real-time reporting deters disclosure bunching around the disclosures of regular and in-play poison pill adoptions to examine whether managers' ability to time events affects whether realtime reporting deters strategic disclosure. I find that real-time reporting does not deter disclosure bunching for regular poison pills, but does deter it for in-play pills. These results suggest that real-time reporting will reduce disclosure bunching only if managers cannot time the underlying event.},

	abstract = {The Internal Revenue Service's net operating loss rules enable corporations to use one year's losses to offset their tax liability in future years. However, a corporation's ability to do so depends on its maintaining the same ownership: if enough of a corporation's stock changes hands, it loses the ability to take advantage of all of its prior losses. In response to the threat of ownership changes, corporations have enacted particularly strict "poison pills," which are designed to prevent stock from changing hands. However, a side effect of these poison pills is that they ameliorate the threat of hostile takeovers, thereby reducing managers' incentives to maximize corporate welfare. In this Comment, I suggest using the appraisal mechanism to alleviate the need for poison pills and ownership-change restrictions by enabling corporations to pursue damages against shareholders who trigger the devaluing of their net operating losses. The proposed appraisal regime properly balances the interests of tax law and corporate law by ensuring that net operating losses will not be freely transferred but will also not serve as an excuse for allowing managerial incentives to deviate from the proper goal of shareholder wealth maximization.

The positive association between hostile takeover threats and firms’ ESG investments is stronger for firms domiciled in states with expanded constituency statutes and for firms with fewer antitakeover provisions. Quasi-natural experiments based on the adoption of poison pill statutes further show that firms domiciled in states with such laws tend to exhibit lower levels of ESG investment after (vs. before) the passage of the statutes. In addition, we find that the probability of receiving hostile bids in a given year is lower for firms that increased their ESG investment in previous years, especially firms with a strong threat of ex-ante hostile takeover. Taken together, our findings suggest that firms use ESG investments as an important antitakeover device and that the threat of corporate hostile takeover has unintended effects on firms’ ESG investment and ethical business practices. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach – This paper employs an empirical methodology that controls for selection bias. Multiple regressions were employed to assess the relationship among the variables. Findings – Stockholder wealth effects of poison pills are positively related to pressure-resistant institutions, which is consistent with effective monitoring. The wealth effects of poison pills, however, are negatively related to pressure-sensitive investors, consistent with passivity. No empirical relation was found between ownership structure and shareholder approved amendments such as classified boards and fair price amendments. Research limitations/implications – This study was conducted as a large sample analysis over an earlier time period that was more applicable for evaluating anti-takeover techniques. Practical implications – The results are consistent with pressure-resistant institutions actively monitoring to prevent unilaterally implemented defense mechanisms of all types, whereas pressure-sensitive institutions appear to more readily accept poison pills. Originality/value – These results suggest that failing to control for the type of outside investor may not clearly portray documented relations in other corporate governance studies. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Such managers may be willing to sacrifice a portion of the recurring component of free cash flow in the form of additional interest expense, as well as to incur the additional monitoring by capital markets, in exchange for control over a greater level of accumulated free cash flow in the form of cash and equivalents. Partial support for this hypothesis is observed for a sample of acquisition targets possessing poison pill defenses, which enhances the likelihood of the required agency behavior. Target firms are observed to have above-average levels of capital expenditures, cash and equivalents, and debt. When regressed on premiums offered to target shareholders, however, only the target debt level is found to be significant. © 1994 Springer.},

After an intense struggle, the two companies merged to become the world’s largest steel which controlled 10% of the global steel business. The deal was valued at $38.3 billion. Arcelor’s directors, including Chief Executive Guy Dolle, had opposed the takeover. The French, Luxembourg, and Spanish governments strongly opposed the takeover. In its first step to prevent the deal, Arcelor transferred its subsidiary, Dofasco, into a trust and adopted the poison pill strategy to keep Mittal from buying Arcelor. The adoption of poison pill made it difficult for Mittal Steel to carry out the deal. Mittal capped his stake under 45% and offered 12 of 18 seats on the board to independent directors, including those from the unions, and also agreed to a lock in on his shares for 5 years. On June 25, 2006, the Arcelor board decided to go ahead with the merger with Mittal Steel and scrapped plans for Severstal Steel. According to the terms of the deal, Arcelor investors received 50.5% of ownership, and Mittal Steel investors received 49.5% of ownership of the merged company. Arcelor shareholders received 13 Mittal Steel shares plus euro 150.60 in cash for 12 Arcelor shares. The combined Arcelor–Mittal accounted for 10% of world’s steel production.

Profit-sharing will be particularly effective, because it gives employees an immediate, legitimate interest in improving the companys performance. Low basic pay plus profit-sharing will keep the economy heading towards full employment because firms will constantly be hiring more workers whose marginal product exceeds their marginal cost. Profit-related pay changes the relationships within companies in ways which make them more cooperative and more efficient economic units.

In this paper, we provide fresh evidence on whether Delaware's dominance arises from its takeover laws being in the best interest of shareholders versus managers by investigating the role of the state in which a firm is incorporated on the firm's adoption of a poison pill. Our results indicate that announcements of adoptions of poison pills by Delaware firms are associated with returns not significantly different from those for non-Delaware firms. Moreover, Delaware firms that adopt poison pills are no more likely to receive a takeover bid, be successfully acquired, or receive better merger terms than non-Delaware firms. Overall, it appears that Delaware law, with regards to takeovers, promotes an environment consistent with a "race to the middle" philosophy, neutral to management and shareholders.},

Through logit and probit regressions, we find that the adoption of poison pills is positively associated with listings in the New Market and Level 2 corporate governance segments. Thus, the adoption of this anti-takeover device by companies that are listed at the highest levels of corporate governance can be useful to current and potential investors since, given the rise of public companies with predominantly dispersed capital in the Brazilian stock market, hostile takeover attempts have been increasingly recurrent. Further, our results contribute theoretically towards a possible convergence between Signaling Theory and the adoption of poison pills, shedding light on the fact that the adoption of this anti-takeover device as a complementary corporate governance mechanism may represent a protection signal issued by companies to the market designed to attract new investors. © 2021 FEA-RP/USP.

Design/methodology/approach – Prior literature has shown that strong shareholder rights, as measured by aggregated shareholder rights indices, could mitigate the agency costs and reduce the cost of equity capital. Stepwise regression method with control variables for financial risks and corporate governance risks is used to empirically test whether individual shareholder rights provisions have varying degrees of impacts on a firm's cost of equity capital. Findings – Of the 24 shareholder rights provisions in the shareholder rights index, four provisions are found to be the most significant determinants of cost of equity capital with the absence of three provisions (poison pill, golden parachute, and control share cash out) and the presence of fair value provision reducing the firm's cost of equity capital. Research limitations/implications – First, the results suggest that a few individual provisions are major determinants of firm value. Hence, investors and regulators should pay the most attention to these provisions. Second, the result that some provisions that limit shareholders' rights actually reduce cost of equity capital suggests that investors and regulators should not view all aspects of weak shareholder rights negatively.

We find that classified boards, poison pills, limits to amend bylaws, and fair price amendments are associated with significantly greater pollution. In contrast, cumulative voting, because it allows a greater voice for minority shareholders, is associated with lower pollution. We create a pollution-based index (the P-index) based on the sum of those governance provisions positively related to pollution plus an indicator for lack of cumulative voting. The P-index has approximately twice as large an association with firm-level pollution as the E-index. Most measures of board structure or compensation have no significant relation with pollution after controlling for the P-index. An instrumental variable analysis suggests a causal relation between the P-index and pollution. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to focus on issues of corporate control around the announcement of the decision of Hertz Global Holdings to relocate its corporate headquarters from New Jersey to Florida in 2013. The relocation decision and accounting irregularities discovered after the announcement raised interest from activist investors. The firm responded by enacting a “poison pill,” but control was eventually wrestled away and the CEO was replaced. Examining these events gives students insights into corporate control issues facing a major US corporation. Design/methodology/approach: This case study presents a history of the firm from its founding in 1918 through 2017, with an emphasis on key events from 2012 through 2017. These events include acquisition of a competing firm (Dollar Thrifty), relocation of corporate headquarters, accounting irregularities, restatement of financials, activist investor responses, issuance of a “poison pill,” and turnover in the CEO position. Findings: The case is intentionally written to “tell the story” of events that relate to issues involving control of the company around the decision to relocate its corporate headquarters. The case highlights potential agency problems between management and shareholders and the market’s response to those problems. Originality/value: No prior case study considers the topic of corporate control from the perspective of Hertz Global Holdings. This case study can be used by instructors in graduate and undergraduate courses to examine corporate control issues from a “real world” perspective. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In the case of each offer and revised offer, data is provided to demonstrate the effect of the merger announcements on the target/bidder's shares. The analysis also considers ways in which bidders proposed to pay for the deals. MCI finally accepted an increased offer from WorldCom which necessitates working out the cost of buying out the existing BT stake in MCI. The Case Study considers public reasons given by MCI for accepting the revised WorldCom bid and examines whether the acquisition was a win - win or win - lose one using the method adopted by Bennett Stewart in Quest for Value which looks at the immediate post-announcement behaviour of share prices.},

Many companies owned by government agencies are likely to be privatised in the coming years and the current administration aims to sell utilities and infrastructure projects to the private sector. Policies for certain government-owned financial institutions are currently being questioned as well. Despite the temporary crunch of capital markets in Korea, mergers and acquisitions will be at the core of Korean economic activities in the next decade. Amidst these developments, however, some have voiced concern about hostile takeover attempts, especially by foreign capital. The past and current regulation of hostile takeovers has been weighed down by securities regulations and corporate laws. Arguments for poison pills are being regurgitated in light of economic reality, which is that there is no separation between management and ownership. This paper argues that such concerns are not relevant to the Korean economy and there is no need for further changes intended to discourage hostile takeover attempts. © LexisNexis, 2010.},

Preferences may reflect information (media coverage) and proximity effects (e.g. to nuclear clean-up sites), and are potentially fraught with uncertainty. To explore these issues, we use a three-year contingent valuation survey (telephone and Internet) from 2006 to 2008 using an advisory referendum for a National Energy Research and Development Fund to estimate annual US household willingness to pay (WTP). Objectives of this analysis include: (i) combining survey data with extensive secondary information sources to explore news media coverage, and proximity effects of distance to the nearest nuclear clean-up site, and (ii) improving WTP modelling via a preference simulation approach (PSA) to a follow-up uncertainty question. Results indicate the presence of a small nuclear “poison pill” effect overall, which decays as distance from a nuclear clean-up site increases. No effect is found for an index of recent energyrelated news media coverage. Finally, improved incorporation of uncertainty using PSA produces conservative WTP estimates with much tighter confidence intervals. © 2015, CESER Publications.},

	abstract = {The permissiveness of corporate defensive measures has been debated since their inception in the mid-1900s. Courts, scholars, and practitioners have grappled with the costs and benefits of these measures to both shareholders and society at large-and for good reason. On one hand, scholars and practitioners argue that defensive measures erode shareholder value by entrenching management, while on the other hand, supporters view defensive measures as valuable tools that allow target boards to appropriately defend against inadequate takeover bids. Delaware courts have confronted this debate in an interesting manner, initially viewing defensive measures as permissible under the business judgment rule, and later assessing them with enhanced scrutiny. But the Delaware courts have never considered defensive measures from a value perspective-or considered that certain defensive measures that depress ESG ratings-thus firm value-may warrant additional judicial scrutiny. This Comment begins from the premise that higher ESG ratings are indicative of greater long-term firm value. As supported by empirical studies conducted over the last decade, the combination of a poison pill and staggered board reduces ESG ratings, and thus reduces long-term firm value. Therefore, this Comment contends that the combination of these measures-the cornerstone of a "just say no" defense-should be assessed with enhanced scrutiny by Delaware courts. These defensive measures must survive heightened review at the "compelling justification" level. If the defensive measures do not survive this heightened standard of review, they must be viewed as an impermissible depression of shareholder value and dilution of shareholder rights. © 2023 University of Pennsylvania Law School.

Their tactics include buying shares, conducting public campaigns, lobbying managers and other shareholders, seeking representation on the board of directors, and sometimes running a proxy contest. In response, boards have adopted a variety of “defensive measures,” including deploying “poison pill” shareholder rights plans against activists. This Article provides a comprehensive policy and doctrinal analysis of the use of poison pills against activists in corporate governance contests (as distinguished from corporate control contests). We argue that, because of the significance of the specific design features—features that have so far received little judicial attention—it is increasingly important to scrutinize pills to assure that they are targeted to address legitimate objectives. Various design features of a pill interact, and features that may be harmless in pills designed to fend off a hostile takeover are unjustifiable in pills employed against an activist hedge fund. While a board acting in good faith should be permitted to use a pill to enhance the shareholder decision-making process, it should, in doing so, act as a “neutral election board.” © 2019 Boston University Law Review.

This paper segregates the wealth‐increasing poison pills from the value‐reducing ones by examining the pattern of insider trading activity prior to the pill adoption announcement. Our results show that pill adoptions that are preceded by net insider purchases are associated with significant stock price increases. This finding is consistent with the proposition that corporate insiders buy their own securities because they do not view the adoption of poison pills as an antitakeover strategy, but rather one that enables the board of directors to extract a greater share of the economic gains from the bidder. Our findings also indicate that firms with net insider sales prior to pill adoption announcement experience generally negative but insignificant changes in value. Finally, firms with no insider trading or with an equal number of insider purchases and sales register marginally significant negative returns. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

	abstract = {Introduction, Today, takeovers of publicly held business firms are understood as an effective and speedy means of resource allocation. Yet the legal framework surrounding takeovers, particularly hostile ones, is not simple. It appears to vary significantly from country to country. With regard to takeover defences, the United States is rich both in its practical experience and academic literature. In contrast, Japan was poor at least until 2005. While courts in Delaware in the United States have shaped the law in this area over the past twenty-five years, Japanese law is not clear despite the existence of several statutory provisions of the Japanese Company Act and certain well-known cases in recent years. Although the United States is rich in its practical experience and academic literature, evidence seems to be inconclusive. Moreover, there is so much debate among commentators that opinions are quite divided among reasonable people. As a result, this area has produced (and still today produces) one of the most difficult issues in US corporate law. First, while empirical studies generally show that hostile takeovers are good for the economy in the sense that they generally enhance the value of the target firms, it is unclear from the past empirical studies whether defence measures adopted by target boards, in particular ‘poison pills’, are good or bad for the target firms (and thus for the economy). © Cambridge University Press 2009.},

	abstract = {The merger mania of the 1980s put top corporate management on the defensive as predators sought takeover targets. Hostile takeover activity has dissipated in recent years, for a variety of reasons, but the ethical issues surrounding acquisitions and mergers and the ethically questionable conduct that is often involved remain as relevant as ever. Most ethical discussions of acquisitions and mergers focus on the ethical conduct of the predator. The ethical conduct of the target company's top management is often overlooked. This chapter reviews the ethical literature on hostile takeovers and applies ethical theory to some of the defensive tactics that have been used to thwart unwanted takeovers. The focus will be on the fiduciary duties of top management and ethical issues involved with poison pills, greenmail, golden parachutes, and other defensive tactics. Both utilitarian and nonutilitarian approaches will be used as tools of analysis. It also reviews the attitude toward the market for corporate control that exists in 23 developing economies. There is much evidence to suggest that most acquisitions and mergers result in a net benefit to the economy (Easterbrook and Fischel, 1981; Ginsburg & Robinson, 1986; Halpern, 1973; Jensen & Ruback, 1983, 1985, 1988). There are more winners than losers. Economists would say that it is a positive-sum game. Yet those who initiate such activity, the "predators," are commonly viewed as greedy, immoral, and uncaring. Greed may be a vice and viewed as an immoral character trait in some religious and philosophical circles. However, those who are greedy and who play within the rules by not resorting to theft, fraud, deception, or murder to achieve their goals actually perform a service for others. This idea is not new by any means. Adam Smith pointed it out in The Wealth of Nations in 1776. Those who have no intention of benefiting others often benefit them more than they know. They try to capture market share by either slashing prices or offering better-quality products or services than the competition. Those who are obsessed with driving their competitors out of business by resorting to low prices and high-quality products and services do much more good for consumers and the general population than those who try to prevent or regulate such predatory practices. While it might not be considered nice to be an uncaring individual, it should not be a trait that is subject to punishment in a court of law. Morality is a highly personal thing. Just because an activity may be considered immoral by some people does not mean that it should be declared illegal. Driving an automobile in Jerusalem on a Saturday afternoon can subject one to being the recipient of projectiles (Orthodox Jews throw rocks at cars on Saturday because of their perception that driving on Saturday is against God's law). Victimless crimes such as prostitution, injecting drugs into your body, dwarf tossing, or suicide do not violate anyone's rights and should not be illegal. One might turn this punishment argument on its head by rightfully advocating the punishment of those who attempt to prevent such consensual activities since they must necessarily violate the contract or property rights of others to accomplish their goal. While it may be true that some predators are greedy, immoral, or uncaring, that is not the topic of discussion for this chapter. This chapter will look at some overlooked - actually ignored - economic and ethical questions. The focus will be on the individuals who attempt to prevent such activities rather than on the predators. But first, let's take a look at the OECD position on the market for corporate control and how closely 23 developing economies follow the OECD (2004) benchmark. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

This study employs the Black and Scholes Option Pricing Model to determine whether or not adoption of poison pill securities increases investor perceptions of firm risk. The results provide evidence that the Option-Implied Standard Deviations of common stock returns increase significantly on the poison pill adoption date, on average. Furthermore, the implied standard deviations remained significantly above pre-adoption levels for several days after the poison pill adoption, suggesting that the perceived increase in firm risk is permanent. These results suggest the poison pills may serve a more constructive role in the governance of publicly traded firms than is generally assumed.},

We find that anti-takeover provisions do not affect investors' average reactions to investment choices. Market responses are heterogeneous; however, and differ according to size, growth opportunity, the availability of free cash flow and exposure to the capital markets. We find evidence consistent with managerial entrenchment when firms are insulated from the threat of takeover and have enough free cash flow to avoid raising external capital. We also find that for small firms, the reaction to capital investment announcements are positively related to free cash flow when managers have high growth opportunities, but negatively related when investment opportunity is small. This result is consistent with Noe (1988), who shows that restricting managers' investment choices to positive NPV projects is necessary to obtain the pecking order results of Myers and Majluf (1984). © 2000 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.},

With a rise in shareholder activism, firms are continuing to include change in control provisions, known as proxy puts, in their debt agreements to counter activist success. Recent litigation regarding the use of these provisions has created a debate as to whether these provisions are valid under Delaware law. Moreover, companies and lending institutions have morphed these provisions into a more restrictive form, known as "dead hand proxy puts." The controversy analyzed in this Note arises out of the use of dead hand proxy puts in debt agreements. The Delaware Chancery Court has considered the issue of proxy puts in three recent cases. On no occasion has the court declared traditional or dead hand proxy puts invalid; the court, however, expressed skepticism toward these provisions. With a recognized entrenchment effect on management and a deterrent effect on the stockholder franchise, the court indicated that they could potentially be invalid in Delaware as a matter of public policy. This Note considers the rise of shareholder activism in the United States and the use of both proxy puts and poison pills to defend against activist investors and hostile takeovers. It analyzes the current debate over dead hand proxy puts and compares these provisions to the already illegal dead hand poison pills. It ultimately argues that dead hand proxy puts should be outlawed in Delaware on the same basis as dead hand poison pills.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Poison pill adoption is often considered as the most effective tactic to fend off an unsolicited takeover bid. However, it is difficult to identify the deterrent effect because the adoption is naturally endogenous. The purpose of this paper is to use plausibly exogenous instruments to mitigate the endogeneity problem. Design/methodology/approach: The author employs two econometric models: the linear probability model and the bivariate probit model to examine the effect of poison pills on the outcome of a takeover. Findings: Using a sample of 655 unsolicited takeovers, the author finds that poison pills substantially reduce the likelihood that a takeover bid, once undesirably placed, is completed. This negative impact strongly supports the manager entrenchment hypothesis in that managers adopt poison pills to ensure the continuation of their private benefits. However, the author finds no strong evidence consistent with the shareholder interest hypothesis that poison pills enhance the management’s ability to negotiate higher premiums or reject inadequate offers. Research limitations/implications: The demise of the market for unsolicited takeovers with the disappearance of poison pills can be explained by the fact that poison pills, if adopted, will have an absolute deterrent effect on the takeover likelihood of success, and targets always have the power to adopt them instantly. Practical implications: There should be policies to limit the power of managers to adopt poison pills because it causes the entrenchment problem which will negatively affect the firm value. Originality/value: The author tackles the problem of the endogeneity of poison pill adoptions. The author shows that poison pills have a strong negative effect on the takeover outcome and the result can explain the decreasing number of unsolicited takeovers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of stock price crash risk on the adoption of poison pills. Design/methodology/approach: The authors estimate logit and probit regressions. Their sample includes 185 Brazilian public firms for the period 2010–2018. Following previous studies, the authors use the negative skewness of firm-specific weekly returns and the down-to-up volatility of firm-specific weekly returns as measures of firm's stock price crash risk. As proxies of poison pills, the authors employ the “conventional” poison pills in their baseline models and the “eternity” poison pills, which prevent the removal of poison pills from bylaws, in additional models. Findings: The authors find that stock price crash risk measures are not associated with poison pill adoption. However, although stock price crash risk does not lead to poison pill adoption as a complementary corporate governance mechanism that protects firms against hostile takeover attempts, further results show that managers do not draw on stock price crash risk as a pretext to entrench themselves. Additional analyses also highlight that CEO power seems to play a role in moderating the relationship between stock price crash risk and eternity poison pill adoption. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the literature on stock price crash risk, which calls for research in international contexts to better understand the effect of stock price crash risk on country-specific idiosyncratic features. The authors discuss a controversial anti-takeover mechanism that has been debated by Brazilian policymakers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

I contend that while past accruals can be thought of as constitutionally protected, it makes no sense to protect the terms of future accruals given that such accruals necessarily depend both on continued employment and on the salary in future years, both of which can unarguably be changed. Next, I discuss a few new developments in pension reform litigation: the use of non- contractual arguments (such as a 2/3rds vote requirement), the use of poison pills in pension reform initiatives, and the intersection of bankruptcy with state constitutional protections for pensions. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The aim of the article is to discuss the challenges of the investment protection mechanisms of the Corporate Law in Georgia within the frames of influence of Common Law and Civil Law. The influence of both legal systems created the unique platform of research and debate. Authors of this article reviewed the relevant academic literature on investment protection mechanisms, but they were unable to find the combination of analysis on minimum capital requirement, piercing the corporate veil, pre-emptive rights and fiduciary duties. Simultaneously, no scholar has emphasized the role of piercing the corporate veil to balance the interests of the creditors during the absence of minimum capital requirement; secondly, pre-emptive rights are not widely considered as the alternative to Poison Pills and with this, the effect of pre-emptive rights as the instrument for antitakeover regulations is diminished. At the same time, the link between the pre-emptive rights and fiduciary duties is also very weak which reduces its antitakeover features and affects the investment protection mechanisms.

	abstract = {The regulations of cross-border data flows is a growing challenge for the international community. International trade agreements, however, appear to be pioneering legal methods to cope, as they have grappled with this issue since the 1990s. The World Trade Organization (WTO) rules system offers a partial solution under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which covers aspects related to cross-border data flows. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) have also been perceived to provide forward-looking resolutions. In this context, this article analyzes why a resolution to this issue may be illusory. While they regulate cross-border data flows in various ways, the structure and wording of exception articles of both the CPTPP and USMCA have the potential to pose significant challenges to the international legal system. The new system, attempting to weigh societal values and economic development, is imbalanced, often valuing free trade more than individual online privacy and cybersecurity. Furthermore, the inclusion of poison-pill clauses is, by nature, antithetical to cooperation. Thus, for the international community generally, and China in particular, cross-border data flows would best be regulated under the WTO-centered multilateral trade law system. © 2020 Brill Academic Publishers.

	abstract = {The use of feedback information is an effective approach to address the vocabulary gap between a user's query and the relevant documents. It has been shown that some relevant documents act like "poison pills," i.e. they hurt the performance of feedback systems despite the fact that they are relevant. In this paper, we study the positive counterpart of this by investigating the helpfulness of nonrelevant documents in feedback. In general, we find that although documents that are explicitly judged as non-relevant are normally assumed to be poisonous for feedback systems, sometimes considering high-scored non-relevant documents as a positive feedback helps to improve the performance of retrieval. In our experimental data, we observe a considerable fraction of non-relevant documents in higher ranked positions of the initial retrieval run, for most of the topics. Hence, by ignoring the potential value of non-relevant documents, we may loose a lot of useful information. We investigate the potential contribution of non-relevant documents using existing state-of-the-art feedback methods. Our main findings are the following. First, we find that some of the nonrelevant documents are exclusively helpful, they improve retrieval on their own, and others are complementary helpful, they lead to further improvement when added to a set of relevant documents. Second, we discover that, on average, exclusively helpful non-relevant documents have a higher contribution to the performance improvement, compared to the complementary ones. Third, we show that non-relevant documents in topics with poor average precision in the initial retrieval are more likely to help in the feedback. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Case overview/synopsis: The case study is about the dilemma faced by Prantik Sinha, co-founder and director of Indian company AIPL, to accept or decline a JV offer from a French industrial conglomerate Serge Ferrari Group SA (SFG). AIPL is a leading manufacturer and trader of biogas storage tanks, water storage tanks, airlifting bags, floating boom barriers, trash floating boom barriers and inflatable swimming pools. The company adopts business-to-business and direct-to-customer business models. It develops products as per clients’ specifications and their exact requirements. In 2022, SFG proposed collaborating with AIPL to market its biogas digesters in India and abroad. As per the partnership deal, AIPL needed to split its biogas digester portfolio and sell it to the proposed JV for a specific one-time value. Sinha believed that the JV was an opportunity to scale the business globally and would likely shape the company’s future. However, he was in a quandary about making a final decision on accepting the JV offer because biogas digesters remained the company’s highest revenue-generating product portfolio. It was against this backdrop, what would Sinha do to accomplish his business objective and protect the interest of the company? The case study highlights Sinha’s commitment to nurture and expand AIPL’s business in India and beyond. It provides ample scope for students to analyze the pros and cons of AIPL’s JV initiative with SFG and suggest whether the company can leverage this offer for business growth.

Methodology: Archival research design was used to gather data in the form of reports of successful suicide commitment were collected from “Daily Express” for ten months from September, 2014 to June, 2015. All possible information related to gender, age, marital status, causes of suicide and mode of suicide was gathered. Data in only one newspaper was included to avoid repetition of news. News with missing important demographic information was excluded. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Out of total 87, more male 50(57.5%) than females 37(42.5%) committed suicide. Most victims of suicide fell in the age range between 20-29 years i.e.,26(29.9%). Mostly unmarried individuals 43(49.4%) committed suicide in comparison with the married individuals who were 33(37.9%). Most of the suicides were committed because of domestic quarrels 45(51.7%). Among different modes of committing suicide, use of poison pills (used as pesticides for wheat) were the highest 48(55.2%). Conclusion: Young males, unmarried individuals and domestic problems were the leading factors for successful suicide attempts. Use of poison pills was the commonest mode of suicide. © 2016, Postgraduate Medical Institute. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this note, the author examines the rights of shareholders to review actions of the board of directors in matters of corporate governance. Over the last few decades, the traditional duties of the board of directors to manage corporate affairs have been challenged as shareholders become more active and unified. A recent corporate governance case in Oklahoma, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Fleming Cos., finally has addressed the balance of the corporate rights and duties between the board and the activist shareholders. The decision increased the range of shareholder power in the takeover context, holding that shareholders have the right to review and force the redemption of a corporation's poison pill. The author contends that for Fleming to have a serious effect on corporate law, other state courts, and more specifically, Delaware state courts, must adopt a similar analysis. The author, however, finds this occurrence unlikely and believes that the Fleming court failed to analyze the issues correctly. To comprehend the problem underlying the Fleming decision, the author analyzes the traditional corporate model and the development of the board of directors' duties in the takeover context. Moreover, he looks to both traditional Delaware precedents and recent Delaware case law to support his contention. The author proposes that instead of adopting decisions like Fleming, courts should recognize the preclusive effects of multiple takeover defenses and attempt to mitigate them accordingly to deter board entrenchment.},

America for Sale recaps the amazing, sometimes incredible events leading up to the sale of Esmark, including intense pressure from the United Steelworkers and the company's major public shareholder to make a decision not in the best interest of all shareholders. It also analyzes the efforts by the Esmark board of directors to observe its fiduciary duty, details the company's "poison pill" effort to raise its sales price, and describes the actions of Leo Gerard and Ron Bloom of the United Steelworkers Union—which led to some surprising alliances. The authors—one Esmark's president and vice chairman of the board, the other an Esmark director, preeminent American economist, and former university president—then provide their own assessment of the Esmark story. They offer legislative and policy prescriptions aimed at making sure U.S. business doesn't devolve into one big garage sale to foreigners seeking to take advantage of the coming decline of the U.S. dollar. © 2009 by Craig T.

It is limited to the methods applied in practice in the Polish capital market, such as the voting cap, or methods potentially applicable to typical situations. Anti-takeover defences that could be effectively used only in exceptional, special situations are not taken into account. The closed corporate governance model prevailing in the Polish capital market is a consequence of the construction of typical control exercised over Polish public companies by strategic investors. Nonetheless, the gradual decrease in involvement by strategic investors, typically company founders, in their businesses and their decision to sell the shares off to financial investors resulted in attempts at hostile takeovers being of a more practical nature. The main claim of this article is that, although Polish law does not allow for the application of typical poison pills based on American solutions, The Polish Code of Commercial Companies and Partnerships-as interpreted in legal literature-remains highly permissive when it comes to the application of various methods aimed at preventing any takeovers of control. The admissibility of defence mechanisms as used by Polish companies requires an extended discussion, which this paper forms a part of, and, potentially, a legislator's systemic intervention.},

	abstract = {Purdue Pharma, the bankrupt drug manufacturer at the center of the opioid crisis, settled its civil and criminal liability for opioid harms with the Department of Justice in a deal that contained a “poison pill” that prevented creditors from objecting to any subsequent plan of reorganization for Purdue: if creditors exercised their rights and pushed for Purdue’s liquidation, they would forfeit all of Purdue’s value to the Department of Justice. This Article argues that Purdue illustrates how the procedural checks and balances that make Chapter 11 bankruptcy a fair and credible system have broken down. Purdue represents the confluence of three trends in bankruptcy: (1) increasingly aggressive and coercive restructuring techniques like the poison pill that lock in the determination of subsequent decisions in the bankruptcy; (2) the lack of appellate review for many key bankruptcy issues; and (3) the rise of “judge-shopping,” facilitated by bankruptcy courts’ local rules that enable debtors to handpick their judge. While each of these trends is problematic in its own right, standing alone they do not undermine the fundamental fairness of the bankruptcy system. Their convergence, however, results in a broken legal system in which a single nonArticle III judge of the debtor’s choosing is the only real check on what the debtor can do in Chapter 11. This situation enables debtors to push through overreaching restructuring transactions that benefit favored creditors and allies at the expense of disfavored creditors, like the opioid victims in Purdue. © 2022, School of Law Publications.

	abstract = {Asian options are path-dependent options whose payoff is based on an average. In some cases, the underlying asset of the option is an average; in others, the strike price itself is computed as an average of the underlying asset recent prices. Asian currency options, as an example, allow corporate users to cover seasonal and so-called strategic foreign exchange positions. Averages are also found in some recent warrant issues, where they are mostly used as poison pills to preclude hostile takeovers. This paper derives a closed-form solution for the valuation of European asian options whose strike price is an average. Both "plain vanilla" average options-i.e. those for which the time interval taken into account for the strike average calculation is the life of the option-and forward-starting average options are considered. The valuation formula is obtained by relying upon a slight linear approximation. Although some previous contributions in the literature already use approximation techniques, our approach contrary to others allows the derivation of a formal upper bound to the approximation error. The numerical values given by this formula are then compared to those generated by an antithetic variate Monte-Carlo method. Based on this comparison and the computation of an upper bound to the approximation error, it is shown that the closed-form solution performs quite well and is obviously computationally efficient. © 1994.},

This study traces the destruction to hubris, managerialism, and the escalation of commitment - elements suggested in previous research. In addition, the case suggests path dependence as a source of wealth destruction in mergers. An elaborate structure of cross-shareholdings, joint committees, and a poison pill made it difficult for the strategic allies (Volvo and Renault) to follow any strategic path other than merger if they wanted to exploit economies more fully. Activism by institutional investors was instrumental in halting the destruction of shareholder wealth and redirecting the firm. This study reveals significant positive abnormal returns associated with the institutional activism. Consistent with , institutional 'jawboning' is valuable. An analysis of the voting premium between Volvo's 'A' and 'B' shares suggests that the value created by institutional voice derived from the strategic change in the firm's direction rather than the power of the coalition of institutional investors to expropriate wealth.},

	abstract = {KCNQ1 (formerly called KVLQT1) is a Shaker-like voltage-gated potassium channel gene responsible for the LQT1 sub-type of LQTS. In general, heterozygous mutations in KCNQ1 cause Romano-Ward syndrome (LQT1 only), while homozygous mutations cause JLNS (LQT1 and deafness). To date, more than 100 families with mutations in this gene have been reported, most with their own novel 'private' mutations. The majority of these mutations are missense. However, other types of mutations, such as deletions, frame-shifts and splice-donor errors have also been reported. There is one frequently reported mutated region (the 'hotspot'). KCNQ1 is now believed to be the most commonly mutated gene in LQTS. The combination of normal and mutant KCNQ1 α-subunits has been found to form abnormal 1KS channels, hence mutations associated with the KCNQ1 gene are also believed to act mainly through a dominant-negative mechanism (the mutant form interferes with the function of the normal wild-type form through a 'poison pill' type mechanism) or loss of function mechanism. Even in the case of carriers of the same mutation, it is currently unknown why there are significant clinical phenotype variations in LQT1 patients. This question could be answered by increasing the number of patient genotypes studied. LQT1 patients experience a majority of their cardiac events (62%) during exercise, and only 3% occur during rest or sleep. Of the patients who experienced cardiac events while swimming, 99% were LQT1. Auditory stimuli are rare and occur in only 2% of patients. However, both lethal and non-lethal events follow the same pattern.},

Not only do these flaws help explain the weak results of such studies, but the flaws are consistent with new evidence on bid outcomes, and recognizing them should improve future research on defenses.},

After contrasting companies along their governance regime, we observe that dictatorship firms, characterized with higher number of governance provisions, are associated with more activist voting by institutional groups: ownership by mutual funds, independent investment advisors and pension funds are significantly related to greater support of shareholder proposals against poison pills. In democratic firms, characterized with lower levels of restrictions on shareholder rights ownership by various shareholder groups is not as highly correlated with support for these proposals, suggesting perhaps that shareholders use other internal channels to voice concerns. In dictatorships, we find that certain shareholders rely on annual meetings to pressure management, and that management is less likely to take action following shareholder votes. Finally, among all institutional shareholders, management seems more likely to respond favorably in the presence of ownership by public pension funds. © 2017},

This study case suggests that corporate lawyers may act as legal entrepreneurs, developing and promoting new legal devices and strategies on behalf of actual and potential clients. If affirmed by the courts, these devices or techniques are rapidly diffused thereby contributing to the creation of new legal knowledge. The creation and successful defense of the shareholder rights' plan led to both new caselaw and statute law. In this way, corporate practitioners contribute to the creation of new legal knowledge, suggesting a bottom‐up approach to knowledge creation rather than the conventional top‐down view. It is suggested that legal innovations like the shareholder rights' plan are more likely to be developed in newer firms than in established firms and in specialized firms than general service law firms.

	abstract = {Over the last fifteen years, numerous finance articles have examined the effect of antitakeover statutes (ATSs) on firm and managerial behavior. In this Article, we evaluate these studies from a theoretical-legal and an empirical-finance perspective. To assess the impact of an antitakeover statute from a theoretical perspective, one has to evaluate how the statute affects the ability of a firm to defend itself in light of the other defenses already available to the firm. The finance studies, by failing to take account of how antitakeover defenses interact and how they function in practice, are based on fundamentally flawed assumptions about the additional protection afforded by antitakeover statutes. In particular, because most firms have access to other, more powerful takeover defenses—specifically, poison pills—standard antitakeover statutes do not materially increase a company’s ability to resist a hostile takeover bid. From the empirical side, the finance studies omit important control variables, use improper specifications, contain errors in coding the year in which states adopted statutes and the companies such statutes cover, and suffer from selection bias and endogeneity. These problems render the empirical results derived by these studies unreliable. Indeed, this Article replicates several of these empirical studies in order to show that their results do not withstand closer scrutiny. This Article has important implications for the debate over whether an increased threat of takeovers acts as a disciplining device or induces short-termism. The finance studies criticized herein have been taken as supplying the single best source of unconfounded empirical evidence in this debate. But if, as this Article will show, these studies suffer from serious flaws, much of the perceived empirical knowledge about the real economic effects of a change in the threat of takeovers has to be reassessed. In the end, decades of empirical studies have yielded little empirical knowledge. © 2016 Stanford Law School. All rights reserved.},

These penalties should deter questionable behavior and enable reputation to serve a social control function, yet we know little about how and when these penalties are actually imposed. Unlike prior research in this vein, we account for the fact that reputational penalties associated with such practices may differ across audiences because of differences in interpretations of the practice and differences in causal attributions about its use. Specifically, we develop theory to explain how and when stock analysts and peer executives applied reputational penalties tomanagers when firms used a poison pill, a prominent anti-Takeover device. We find that the reputational penalties associated with poison pills differed substantially between these two groups and that these groups applied different penalties depending on the media coverage that the poison pill received, the performance of the firm, and the extent to which the practice had already been adopted. The findings suggest that reputational penalties for questionable behaviors may be more contingent and harder to sustain than previously thought. © Academy of Management Journal.},

	abstract = {Over the past twenty years, a growing number of empirical studies have provided evidence that governance arrangements protecting incumbents from removal promote managerial entrenchment, reducing firm value. As a result of these studies, “good” corporate governance is widely understood today as being about stronger shareholder rights. This Article rebuts this view, presenting new empirical evidence that challenges the results of prior studies and developing a novel theoretical account of what really matters in corporate governance. Employing a unique dataset that spans from 1978 to 2008, we document that protective arrangements that require shareholder approval-such as staggered boards and supermajority requirements to modify the charter-are associated with increased firm value. Conversely, protective arrangements that do not require shareholder approval-such as poison pills and golden parachutes-are associated with decreased firm value. This evidence suggests that limiting shareholder rights serves a constructive governance function as long as the limits are the result of mutual agreement between the board and shareholders. This function commits shareholders to preserve a board’s authority to exploit competitive private information and pursue long-term wealth maximization strategies. By documenting that committing shareholders to the longer term matters as much as, if not more than, reducing entrenchment for good corporate governance, our analysis sheds much needed light on the allocation of power between boards and shareholders, managerial accountability, and stakeholder interests. We conclude by outlining the implications of our analysis concerning the direction corporate governance policies ought to take. © 2016 by K.J. Martijn Cremers, Saura Masconale & Simone M. Sepe.},

They are based on detailed and intensive fieldwork in large Japanese companies and interviews with investors, civil servants, and policy makers in the period following the adoption of significant corporate law reforms in the early 2000s up to the months just before the global financial crisis of 2008. At the start of the decade, the time seemed right for Japan to move to a shareholder value-driven, "Anglo-American" system of corporate governance. Instead, an adjustment and renewal of the postwar model of the large Japanese corporation has taken place. Japanese managers have adapted to and reshaped corporate governance norms, using them to reform internal decision-making structures. The board's role is seen in terms of strategic planning rather than monitoring, and external directors are viewed as advisers, not as representatives of the shareholders. Companies have responded to the threat of hostile takeovers by putting poison pills in place and have rebuffed hedge fund activists' demands for higher dividends and share buybacks. Although shareholder influence is more extensive than it was, central aspects of the Japanese "community firm" - in particular, managerial autonomy and a commitment to stable or "lifetime" employment for core of employees - largely remain in place. The Japanese experience suggests that there are limits to the global convergence of company law systems, and that the widespread association of Anglo-American practices with the "modernization" of corporate governance may have been misplaced. © Oxford University Press, 2009.

Actavis, the Supreme Court held that these payments could violate the antitrust laws. In the wake of the decision, courts, the parties, and commentators have been fiercely debating the question of what constitutes a payment, with courts reaching divergent outcomes. This Article offers a framework that answers this question. It first articulates two justifications based on litigation costs and brand payments for generic services. It then introduces a test based on whether the brand conveys to the generic a type of consideration not available as a direct consequence of winning the lawsuit. Such a showing - accompanied by a finding of an exclusion payment that violates the antitrust laws - demonstrates that the generic's exclusion from the market is based on the payment rather than the patent. Applying the framework, the Article finds that the test is satisfied when generics delay entering the market after receiving cash, "poison pill" clauses allowing the acceleration of generic entry, and brand agreements not to introduce their own generics. In contrast, the test is not satisfied when the brand forgives damages accrued by a generic that has entered the market. The test thus solves the puzzle articulated by Judge Posner that every settlement provides something of value to the generic. And it offers a framework that resolves a contentious issue with significant consequences for health care and the economy while being consistent with common sense, economics, and the policies underlying the relevant legal regimes.},

Inside the firm, boards and managers see that the too-big firm can be more efficient and more profitable if restructured via spinoffs and sales. But a major corrective for industrial firm overexpansion fails to constrain large, too-big-to-fail financial firms when (1) the funding boost that the firm captures by being too-big-to-fail sufficiently lowers the firm's financing costs and (2) a resized firm or the spun-off entities would lose that funding benefit. Propositions (1) and (2) have both been true and, consequently, a major retardant to industrial firm overexpansion has gone missing for large financial firms.

	abstract = {Financial innovation has fundamental implications for the key substantive and informationbased mechanisms of corporate governance. "Decoupling" undermines classic understandings of the allocation of voting rights among shareholders (via, e.g., "empty voting"), the control rights of debtholders (via, e.g., "empty crediting" and "hidden interests"/"hidden non-interests"), and of takeover practices (via, e.g., "morphable ownership" to avoid section 13(d) disclosure and to avoid triggering certain poison pills). Stock-based compensation, the monitoring of managerial performance, the market for corporate control, and other governance mechanisms dependent on a robust informational predicate and market efficiency are undermined by the transparency challenges posed by financial innovation. The basic approach to information that the SEC has always used-The "descriptive mode," which relies on "intermediary depictions" of objective reality-is manifestly insufficient to capture highly complex objective realities, such as the realities of major banks heavily involved with derivatives. Ironically, the primary governmental response to such transparency challenges-A new system for public disclosure that became effective in 2013, the first since the establishment of the SEC-Also creates difficulties. This new parallel public disclosure system, developed by bank regulators and applicable to major financial institutions, is not directed primarily at the familiar transparency ends of investor protection and market efficiency. As starting points, this Article offers brief overviews of: (1) the analytical framework developed in 2006-2008 for "decoupling" and its calls for reform; and (2) the analytical framework developed in 2012-2014 reconceptualizing "information" in terms of three "modes" and addressing the two parallel disclosure universes. As to decoupling, the Article proceeds to analyze some key post-2008 developments (including the status of efforts at reform) and the road ahead. A detailed analysis is offered as to the landmark December 2012 TELUS opinion in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, involving perhaps the most complicated public example of decoupling to date. The Article discusses recent actions on the part of the Delaware judiciary and legislature, the European Union, and bankruptcy courts-And the pressing need for more action by the SEC. At the time the debt decoupling research was introduced, available evidence as to the phenomenon's significance was limited. This Article helps address that gap. As to information, the Article begins by outlining the calls for reform associated with the 2012-2014 analytical framework. With revolutionary advances in computer-And web-related technologies, regulators need no longer rely almost exclusively on the descriptive mode rooted in intermediary depictions. Regulators must also begin to systematically deploy the "transfer mode" rooted in "pure information" and the "hybrid mode" rooted in "moderately pure information." The Article then shows some of the key ways that the new analytical framework can contribute to the SEC's comprehensive and long-needed new initiative to address "disclosure effectiveness," including in "depiction-difficult" contexts completely unrelated to financial innovation (e.g., pension disclosures and high technology companies). The Article concludes with a concise version of the analytical framework's thesis that the new morphology of public information-consisting of two parallel regulatory universes with divergent ends and means-is unsustainable in the long run and involve certain matters that need statutory resolution. However, certain steps involving coordinating among the SEC, the Federal Reserve, and others can be taken in the interim.},

By 1995, the majority of firms had implemented differing types of charter amendments, poison pills or other governance provisions that are potentially harmful to shareholders. Most firms have adopted multiple and even redundant governance provisions. Shareholders are more likely to approve an increase in the power of the boards of directors of better performing firms, while the boards of poorly performing firms are much more likely to initiate governance changes, such as poison pills, that circumvent shareholder approval.

Using new data from the 2002-2004 proxy seasons, we analyze shareholder voting patterns on these proposals, board reactions to them, and market responses. We find some big changes from earlier periods: many more proposals are receiving majority shareholder support during our sample period relative to earlier studies, and this support has translated into directors implementing more of the actions called for by shareholders. In particular, boards are increasingly willing to remove important anti-takeover defenses, such as the classified board and poison pill, in response to shareholders' requests, something rarely seen in the past. Despite the increase in support for shareholder proposals and board action in response, we find small and insignificant stock market reaction. We conclude that shareholder proposals under Rule 14a-8 have an emerging role in reducing agency costs by increasing director responsiveness to shareholder concerns to open the market more fully to corporate control. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The authors first argue that the sanctioning of the poison pill and the "just say no" defense by Delaware courts was far less consequential than feared by its critics and hoped for by its proponents. Rather, market participants adapted to these legal developments by embracing two adaptive devices-greater board independence and increased incentive compensation-which had the effect of transforming the pill, a potentially pernicious governance tool, into a device that is plausibly in shareholders' interest. Interestingly, however (and for critics of the pill, disconcertingly), market participants neither tried to change the law nor opt out of it. The authors place these developments in a broader perspective. They draw a distinction between bilateral devices-which enjoy support from both stockholders and managers-and unilateral devices, and argue that bilateral devices are more likely to be welfare-enhancing, are more stable, are privileged by Delaware law, and tend to further Delaware's status as leading domicile for public corporations. Greater board independence and increased incentive compensation are examples of such bilateral devices The authors conclude by examining why Delaware courts embraced the poison pill (at the time, a largely unilateral device, albeit one with bilateral features) and how they should deal with the use of pills by companies with staggered boards.},

	abstract = {The decade of the 1980s witnessed the emergence of shareholder control as an issue of considerable interest to investors. The controversy surrounding hostile takeovers and antitakeover provisions focuses attention on managerial motivation for adopting defensive measures such as poison pills. Whether the adoption of a poison pill is in the best interests of shareholders depends upon which of two competing theories best conforms to reality. Management entrenchment theorists argue that poison pills reduce shareholder wealth, while short-term myopia advocates claim that adoption of poison pills will not decrease and may increase shareholder wealth. Numerous studies have examined the market's reaction to the adoption of poison pills and they tend to support the management entrenchment hypothesis. This study expands upon previous investigations in that we investigate managerial behaviour in the context of O.E. Williamson's work on transaction cost economics (Corporate finance and corporate governance, Journal of Finance, 1988, XLIII, pp. 567-91). The underlying hypothesis is that poison pill adoptions may be rational responses by management to conditions inside and outside of the corporation undertaken to minimize transaction costs. Our findings support that hypothesis. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {For many years academics have debated whether it is better to permit hostile acquirers to use tender offers to gain control over unwilling target companies, or to force them to use corporate elections of boards of directors in these efforts. The Delaware courts have expressed a strong preference for shareholder voting as a change of control device in hostile acquisitions. To force acquirers to accept their preferences, the Delaware courts have developed a jurisprudence permitting the effective classified board (ECB), a poison pill combined with a classified board, to protect target company management from removal by a hostile tender offer alone, or through a single corporate election. For companies with ECBs, this means that a determined acquirer must engage in two corporate elections over a period of two years to force entrenched managers to give up power. In this Article, Professors Edelman and Thomas examine whether proxy contests, tender offers, or combined proxy contest/tender offers are more likely to result in value maximizing outcomes for shareholders when target companies are able to deploy defensive tactics. The authors begin by showing that prior work suffers from serious flaws involving the use of voting models that are inappropriate for analyzing proxy contests. To develop a more realistic approach to these questions, the authors employ a probabilistic version of a standard weighted voting model that explicitly incorporates two critical features of corporate voting: first, that shares are normally voted in large blocks rather than in single shares; and second, that independent third party proxy voting advisors play an important, and often pivotal, role in determining the outcome of corporate elections. In addition, the authors explicitly incorporate information about the size of different corporate constituencies and their voting preferences. Using their model, Professors Edelman and Thomas show experimentally how the distribution of shares among various investor constituencies will affect the outcome of different types of voting contests. Using this model, and these different sets of assumptions, the authors find that neither proxy contests, tender offers, nor combined proxy contests and tender offers will always lead to the desirable outcome for target company shareholders in any scenario. With each type of acquisition technique, bidders succeed in obtaining control of the target company in some value decreasing transactions, and are defeated in their acquisition efforts in some value increasing transactions. These results hold whether the authors permit existing defensive tactics or eliminate them. Professors Edelman and Thomas conclude that in order to properly analyze the role of defensive tactics, courts must take into account the underlying shareholder ownership patterns. This requires them to engage in a fact sensitive analysis of whether defensive tactics are impeding or facilitating the maximization of shareholder value. When the authors examine the Delaware Chancery Court's decisions, the reasonableness analysis that the courts have employed to decide whether to overturn defensive tactics permits them to do so. The authors recommend that the courts continue to apply this type of analysis in the future with more direct consideration of the impact of the underlying ownership structure in determining whether the defenses are being used to maximize shareholder value.},

We present new evidence documenting that, on average, there is a significant wealth loss experienced by bondholders at poison pill adoption announcement, while stockholders are unaffected. Our finding of significant bondholder losses is consistent with the proposed negative signal hypothesis. We document results which indicate that bondholders correctly anticipate the degree of leverage increase at the time of the announcement. We also show that the proportion of insider ownership is negatively related to bondholder wealth effect at announcement. This supports the notion that higher insider (manager) ownership leads to a greater alignment of manager-stockholder interests while increasing the stockholder-bondholder agency costs. Long-run analysis of leverage and performance measures reveal that pill adopting firms are not under-leveraged as compared to their industry rivals. However, supporting the negative signal hypothesis, the leverage of sample firms rises significantly after the pill adoption. Performance measures reveal that sample firms significantly underperform their industry cohorts. This result suggests that poison pill adoptions are motivated by poor managers attempting to immunize themselves from the disciplinary actions of the corporate control market.},

	abstract = {Exploiting a hand-collected database with almost 2,200 firms during 1996–2014, I analyze the relationship between the presence of poison pills and firm value. Consistent with earlier results, I document a strong negative association between pills and firm value cross-sectionally and within firm. However, I document that all the within-firm association is driven by pill adoptions (and none by the dropping of pills), all the drop in value associated with adoptions precedes the pills’ adoption, and firms adopted their pills after experiencing drops in their operating performance. These results indicate that the ostensive negative effect of pills on firm value is due to a spurious correlation and that prior analyses were incorrect in concluding that pill adoptions are harmful and indicative of bad governance. Moreover, the results question the usefulness of the dramatic drop in the incidence of pills that took place during the last decade. © 2019 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Snapchat's initial public offering, which provided shares with no voting rights, is a culmination of the growing trend of dual-class shares. It contradicts the precept of one-share, one-vote that is essential for corporate democracy. Snapchat's action caused an uproar among influential investors. In January 2017, a coalition of the world's biggest money managers, which together control more than $17 trillion in assets, demanded a total ban on dual-class shares. We reason that the increasing prominence of dual-class stock is explained by the confluence of three economic trends: the growing importance of intangible investments, the rise of activist investors, and the decline of staggered boards and poison pills. A dual-class structure offers immunity against proxy contests initiated by short-term investors. It enables managers to ignore capital market pressures and to avoid myopic actions such as cutting research and development, which hurt companies in the long term. Thus, a dual-class structure is optimal in certain scenarios. We put forth alternatives to dual-class structure that enable managers to maintain control while retaining focus on sustainable value creation. © 2018 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University},

Based on agency theory, the authors examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than substitutes. © The Author(s) 2012.},

The findings suggest that the potential entrenchment resulting from the reduced threat of external control provided by antitakeover provisions may allow the CEO to deliver a lower level of firm performance relative to their compensation. At first glance, the state antitakeover provisions appear to be insignificant in the presence of firm-specific amendments. However, further analysis reveals they can play an important role, in some cases reinforcing the effects of the firm-specific amendments. With respect to the firm-specific amendments, the negative relation is associated with the presence of blank check preferred stock and poison pill amendments.

	abstract = {Big investment managers, such as Vanguard and Fidelity, have accumulated an astonishing amount of common stock in America's public companies-so much that they now have enough corporate votes to control entire industries. What, then, will these big managers do with their potential power? This Article argues that they will do less than we might think. And the reason is paradoxical: the biggest managers are too big to be activists. Their great size creates intense internal conflicts of interest that make aggressive activism extremely difficult or even impossible. The largest managers operate hundreds of different investment funds, including mutual funds, hedge funds, and other vehicles that all invest in the same companies at the same times. This structure inhibits activism, because it turns activism into a source of internal conflict. Activism by one of a manager's funds can damage the interests of the manager's other funds. If a BlackRock hedge fund invests in a company's equity, for instance, at the same time a BlackRock mutual fund invests in the company's debt, then any attempt by either fund to turn the company in its favor will harm the interests of the other fund. The hedge fund and mutual fund might similarly come into conflict over the political and branding risks of activism and the allocation of costs and profits. Federal securities regulation and poison pills can create even more conflicts, often turning activism by a hedge fund into serious legal problems for its manager's entirely passive mutual funds. A big manager, in other words, is like a lawyer with many clients: its advocacy for one client can harm the interests of another. The debate about horizontal shareholding and index fund activism has ignored this truth. Research on horizontal ownership tends to treat a manager and its funds as though they were a single unit with no differences among them. Traditional analyses of institutional shareholder activism tend to go the opposite direction, treating mutual funds as though they were totally independent with no connection to other funds under the same management. By introducing a subtler understanding of big managers' structures, I can make sense of shareholder activism more clearly. Among other things, I show why aggressive activism tends to come entirely from small managers-that is, from the managers whose potential for activism is actually the weakest. © 2019 University of Southern California.

	abstract = {This Article critically analyzes News Corp.'s reincorporation in Delaware against the backdrop of two major contemporary corporate governance debates relating to shareholder empowerment and convergence theory. Legal scholars opposing greater shareholder power often argue that the lack of shareholder participatory rights under U.S. law provides evidence that such rights are neither desired nor valued by investors. Also, an underlying assumption of convergence theory is that a unified "Anglo-American" model of shareholder protection exists, suggesting that shareholder rights are similarly restricted throughout the common law world. This Article challenges both these assumptions by means of a detailed case study of News Corp.'s migration from Australia to Delaware. News Corp.'s original reincorporation proposal prompted a revolt by a number of institutional investors, who argued that a move to Delaware would strengthen managerial power and reduce shareholder rights. The institutional investors were particularly concerned about the effect of the move on the ability of the board of directors to adopt anti-takeover mechanisms, such as poison pills, which are not generally permissible under Australian law. This Article places News Corp.'s reincorporation in Delaware within the framework of contemporary corporate governance theory and debate. It also uses the reincorporation to highlight a number of significant, but underappreciated, differences between U.S. corporate law and the law of other common law jurisdictions. Specifically, this Article shows how News Corp.'s migration from Australia to Delaware effectively subverted shareholder rights. The News Corp. reincorporation, in sum, has significant implications for Delaware law generally, and for current shareholder empowerment developments in the United States.},

While overall provision use is not systematically related to industry grouping, the uses of some types of provisions are correlated. Most notably, supermajority vote requirements, classified boards, and shareholder meeting requirements tend to be used in concert. Firms reincorporating to Delaware tend to eliminate cumulative voting, and coverages by certain types of state antitakeover laws are correlated.

Coates IV & Guhan Subramanian, The Powerful Antitakeover Force of Staggered Boards: Theory, Evidence, and Policy, 54 STAN. L. REV. 887 (2002). Bebchuk, Coates, and Subramanian's data demonstrate that (1) the incidence of staggered boards has increased substantially in the last two decades and (2) most, if not all, of this increase can be linked to the staggered board's utility as a takeover defense. In response, they offer a policy prescription "stated simply" as: "Courts should not allow managers to continue blocking a takeover bid after they lose one election conducted over an acquisition offer." It is this recommendation and the normative foundations on which it is premised, rather than the minutiae of their empirical analysis and theoretical models, which are the focus of this Response. Like much of modern academic commentary on corporate law, Bebchuk, Coates, and Subramanian's policy recommendation rests on the principle of shareholder primacy. In contrast, this Response argues that corporate law is better understood as a system of director primacy in which the board of directors is not a mere agent of the shareholders, but rather is a sort of Platonic guardian serving as the nexus of the various contracts making up the corporation. The Response concludes by proposing a director primacy-based standard for reviewing the tandem use of classified boards and poison pills as an alternative to Bebchuk, Coates, and Subramanian's proposed prophylactic bar on their use.},

Research, however, has rarely examined how investors interpret signals that are equivocal. We suggest that sensemaking serves as an important process by which investors interpret firm signals, and salient contextual cues influence the sensemaking process. We examine an equivocal signal, the adoption of a poison pill, as a means of examining investor interpretation of the signal and the role of contextual cues in influencing interpretation. Using a sample of 578 poison pill adoptions and controlling for self-selection, we find that investors react negatively to poison pills adopted to protect net operating losses (NOL poison pills) but positively to poison pills adopted when the firm is in receipt of a takeover offer (in-play poison pills). Assessing the role of contextual cues, our results suggest that CEO duality, the proportion of inside directors on the firm’s board, the firm’s R&D investments, and industry concentration also condition investor response to specific-purpose poison pill adoption. Our study contributes to research on signaling theory, sensemaking, and corporate governance by examining how investors interpret a firm’s equivocal governance decisions. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

Moreover, the empirical results of this paper indicate that the market reacts equally negatively to both non-operating provisions that require stockholder approval and to operating provisions that do not require stockholder approval.

At a minimum, managers are required to protect shareholder's interests when other stakeholders are unaffected by their decision. This ethical imperative has been established in the literature. In cases of conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders, the board of directors of the firm has an ethical obligation to shareholders. The structure of the board can affect its ability to fulfill this obligation. Two specific cases where managerial actions have been argued to be unethical are the adoption of classified boards and poison pills. In this study, we empirically analyze the role of board structure in protecting shareholder rights in the specific case of antitakeover provisions. We test this question on a sample of firms whose shareholders have voted to remove antitakeover provisions and find that independent, focused boards are more likely to accede to shareholder resolutions than are less independent boards. Board size is also important and related to other board structures. We draw implications of this finding for future research on the ethics of board governance. © 2008. Business Ethics Quarterly.},

Barriers to shareholder activism have historically been high but we document an unprecedented wave of block acquisitions by hedge fund and other investors with a total of 916 stakes reported in the period between 1998 and 2009. There is, on average, a positive stock price reaction to the announcement of activist investments, particularly for events involving hostile funds. The long-run returns on activism are positive only for events involving hostile funds. We find that activists have forced target firm managers to increase their payouts compared to peer firms, and there is some evidence of change in corporate governance. Finally, after 2006 there was a widespread adoption of “poison pills” by firms, particularly those targeted by activists, and a subsequent drop in investor activism. Our paper shows how U.S.-style activist investors are responsible for the “import” of corporate governance mechanisms from the U.S. into a foreign market. © 2017},

Such challenges, we show, could well have a major impact on the corporate-law landscape.; The Williams Act established a federal regime regulating unsolicited tender offers, but states subsequently developed a body of state antitakeover laws that impose additional impediments to such offers. In a series of well-known cases during the 1970s and 1980s, the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, held some of these state antitakeover laws preempted by the Williams Act. To date, however, federal courts and commentators have paid little attention to the possibility that the state-law rules authorizing the use of poison pills—the most powerful impediment to outside buyers of shares—are also preempted.; Our study examines this subject and concludes that there is a substantial basis for questioning the continued validity of current state-law rules authorizing the use of poison pills. The Essay shows that these rules now impose tighter restrictions on unsolicited offers than those once imposed by state antitakeover regulations that the federal courts invalidated on preemption grounds. Preemption challenges to these poison-pill rules could well result in their invalidation by the federal courts.; Finally, we discuss how state lawmakers could revise poison-pill rules to make them more likely to survive a federal preemption challenge. This could be done, we show, by imposing substantial limits on the length of time during which a poison pill can be used to block tender offers. Whether preemption challenges lead to invalidation of existing poison-pill state rules or to their substantial modification, such challenges could well reshape the market for corporate control. © 2014, Columbia Law Review Association.

Theoretically, it is not obvious whether takeover defences alleviate or exacerbate earnings management. Four well-known corporate takeover defences are examimed: blank check preferred stock, poison pills, classified boards and dual class stock. In spite of their similarity as takeover defences, the empirical evidence indicates that they do not influence the degree of earnings management in the same way. Specifically, blank check preferred stock does not have a significant impact on earnings management. Poison pills and classified boards are found to reduce earnings management, on average, by 1.9% and 1.5% respectively. On the contrary, dual class stock exacerbates earnings management by increasing the degree of abnormal accruals by 2.6% on average. The results are robust even after controlling for firm size, profitability, financial distress, growth opportunities and information asymmetry. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

Drawing on regulatory focus theory and the literature on source credibility, we develop novel arguments as to how a gains-versus-nonlosses framing and the perceived credibility of the speaker influence stakeholder responses, as well as how the effectiveness of these aspects is influenced by context. We test our arguments using data on the framing of the adoption of "poison pills" by U.S. firms between 1983 and 2008. Using content analysis and an event study, we find that a gains framing aligned with the dominant institutional logic leads to a positive stock market reaction, while statements emanating from speakers with potentially self-serving interests negatively affect the stock market reaction. Our findings further show that the effectiveness of framing and source credibility are dependent on contextual attributes such as speaker visibility, prior performance, and practice prevalence. © Academy of Management Journal.},

Many mathematical models promise to make probabilistic forecasts. This raises the question of exactly what these models deliver: can they provide the results as advertised? The aim of this paper is to urge some caution. Using the example of the logistic map, we argue that if a model is non-linear and if there is only the slightest model imperfection, then treating model outputs as decision relevant probabilistic forecasts can be seriously misleading. This casts doubt on the trustworthiness of model results. This is nothing short of a methodological disaster: probabilistic forecasts are used in many places all the time and the realisation that probabilistic forecasts cannot be trusted pulls the rug from underneath many modelling endeavours. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.},

	abstract = {It is easy sport to criticize the Delaware takeover cases as inconsistent with the empirical evidence, each other, and a sensible allocation of power between managers and shareholders. We in fact believe all of these things. Here, however, we offer a more sympathetic account of the core Delaware takeover cases. We argue that they reflect an often unstated "hidden value" model, in which a firm's true value is visible to corporate directors but not to shareholders or potential acquirers. We explore the assumptions needed to make the hidden value model internally consistent, and contrast those assumptions to those that underlie to a "visible value" model in which shareholders and potential acquirers are well informed about firm value or can be made so through disclosure by the target's board. (One outcome of carefully stating the hidden value model 's assumptions is to expose the model's problems.) We also address and reject a "control premium" theory, sometimes invoked by the Delaware courts, in which control is a corporate asset that the law protects by imposing Revlon duties on the target's board. Assuming that the Delaware courts continue to embrace hidden value, we argue that takeover decisions should, at a minimum, be governed by a bilateral decision-making structure, in which a target board's initial decision to approve an acquisition, block a takeover bid, or choose one bidder over another must be approved or rejected by share-holders. Under this approach, target boards could adopt modest deal protections and say "no" to a takeover bid by adopting a poison pill, but could not say "never" by using a staggered board to block a bid after the bidder wins a proxy contest. The courts must also strictly limit efforts by target boards to stuff the ballot box or otherwise alter shareholder vote outcomes.},

This alternative recently was proposed by Professors Lucian Bebchuk and Alan Ferrell, who are particularly critical of the takeover jurisprudence of Delaware, the state that dominates the jurisdictional competition for corporate charters. The Article analyzes the legal basis for Delaware's takeover decisions, particularly the decisions validating the use of the poison pill. Contrary to the Bebchuk-Ferrell analysis, DE judges have shown themselves to be quite sensitive to shareholders' concerns, and quite welcoming of lawsuits against corporate officers and directors. There is no reason to believe that the quality of U.S. corporate governance would improve if new federal takeover rules were enacted. It is quite likely that the quality of the market for corporate control would deteriorate substantially if the changes proposed by Bebchuk and Ferrell were implemented. There is no theoretical or empirical support for the notion that the federal government would be willing to engage in the sort of power-sharing arrangement that Bebchuk and Ferrell propose.},

Do such impediments act in the interest of management by promoting entrenchment or do they act in shareholder interest by improving bargaining power during the takeover auction process? We first confirm the growing trend of takeover impediments over time in our sample. We then relate these trends to changes in the takeover auction process over time. Although we corroborate prior findings of a decline in hostile takeovers and publicly reported takeover auctions between the 1980s and later time periods, we find that takeover competition across the entire auction process between deal initiation and completion has not declined. In effect, takeover competition via auctions has gone underground. Moreover, takeover premiums have not declined over time. We interpret the results to be consistent with the shareholder interest/bargaining power hypothesis and inconsistent with the management interest/entrenchment hypothesis.

	abstract = {If managers induce employees to hold company stock in defined contribution pension plans as a form of takeover defense, then changes in state laws that enhance managerial protection should lead to a reduction in employer stock in 401(k) plans. Delaware's mid-1990s validation of the poison pill in conjunction with a staggered board was followed by a significant decline in employee ownership within defined contribution plans for firms incorporated in Delaware. Evidence using governance data suggests that this is due to responses of firms with staggered boards. Binary choice models confirm that employee ownership in defined contribution plans lowers takeover probabilities. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper examines whether takeover defenses (i.e., poison pills and classified boards) can enhance the bargaining position of the target firm, especially when the target advisor is a top-tier investment bank. I find that classified boards and poison pills are positively linked to target's share of merger gains, target announcement returns, and premiums when the target employs a top-tier advisor and the acquisition is initiated by the acquirer. These results support the argument that top-tier target advisors might be more effective in utilizing takeover defenses in deal negotiations to enhance the bargaining position of their client firms and help them capture higher returns and share of merger gains. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {This study examines the impact of staggered boards, poison pills and unequal voting rights on corporate innovation intensity using a sample of listed firms in six Asian countries from 2010 to 2017. We analyze the differential effects of antitakeover provisions using the high order fixed effects panel data model that controls for firm fixed effects, industry-year fixed effects and country-year fixed effects. The propensity score matching is used to deal with possible endogeneity issues. This paper provides evidence that staggered boards impede R&D investments. In contrast we show that unequal voting rights and poison pill provisions have no significant effect on long term R&D investments. We also find that a combination of a staggered board and a poison pill provision discourages innovation investments. This study uncovers an economic mechanism on the differential effects of antitakeover provisions on R&D responsiveness to firm investment sets. Staggered boards decrease the sensitivity of R&D to the investment opportunity set, resulting to higher innovative inefficiency. The managerial moral hazard effect of staggered boards disproportionately contributes to low firm performance in innovative firms. This study provides evidence on the source of the efficiency loss from staggered boards by pointing to its governance role in promoting more inefficient allocation of R&D capital. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, academics have generated a large empirical literature examining whether antitakeover defenses like poison pills or staggered board provisions decrease the wealth of shareholders in target corporations. Many studies, however, rely primarily on ex post analysis-they consider only how antitakeover defenses (ATDs) influence shareholder wealth after the corporation has been formed and, in some cases, long after the ATD was adopted. This Response argues that it may be impossible to fully understand the purpose or effects of ATDs without also considering their ex ante effects. In particular, ATDs may increase net target shareholder wealth ex ante if they encourage nonshareholder groups to make extracontractual investments in corporate team production. The Response reviews recent empirical evidence suggesting that shareholders do in fact perceive ATDs as beneficial ex ante. It also explores some implications for contemporary corporate scholarship and the attempt to measure the wealth effects of antitakeover rules.},
