   Pills Effect},

Abstract = {Objective: This study aims to investigate whether eternity poison pills
   influence the earnings management level of Brazilian public companies.
   Method: We collect data from the bylaws obtained on the website of the
   Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission, aiming to identify the use
   of poison pills and ``eternity{''} clauses by 235 non-financial
   companies. The information needed to estimate discretionary accruals
   using the Jones Modified model, and the control variables included in
   the econometric model, were obtained through the Bloomberg (R) database.
   For the data analysis, we use quantile regression, considering the
   outliers present in the sample.
   Originality/Relevance: This study fills a gap in the literature
   regarding the effect of eternity poison pills on discretionary accruals,
   given that this relationship has not been explored in the Brazilian
   context. Thus, it is relevant for investors and regulators because it
   provides evidence on the effects of implementing this anti-takeover
   mechanism.
   Results: The main results provide novel evidence on the relationship
   between poison pills and earnings management in the Brazilian context,
   demonstrating that this anti-takeover device, when associated with an
   ``eternity{''} bylaw clause, is positively related to discretionary
   accruals.
   Theoretical contributions: It contributes theoretically by showing that
   the managerial entrenchment caused by the adoption of poison pills with
   ``eternity{''} clauses may reduce the accounting information quality,
   shedding light for investors and regulators about this effect of
   implementing this anti-takeover mechanism.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the interaction between governance mechanisms and the
   effectiveness of shareholder activism by examining shareholder-initiated
   proposals on poison pills. After contrasting companies along their
   governance regime, we observe that dictatorship firms, characterized
   with higher number of governance provisions, are associated with more
   activist voting by institutional groups: ownership by mutual funds,
   independent investment advisors and pension funds are significantly
   related to greater support of shareholder proposals against poison
   pills. In democratic firms, characterized with lower levels of
   restrictions on shareholder rights ownership by various shareholder
   groups is not as highly correlated with support for these proposals,
   suggesting perhaps that shareholders use other internal channels to
   voice concerns. In dictatorships, we find that certain shareholders rely
   on annual meetings to pressure management, and that management is less
   likely to take action following shareholder votes. Finally, among all
   institutional shareholders, management seems more likely to respond
   favorably in the presence of ownership by public pension funds.},

   Stock price increases are driven by (1) firms in which activist

   had high exposure to the crisis. Likewise, we find a positive reaction
   to pills with provisions directed at stalling activists' interventions.
   Our results suggest that crisis pills that target potentially disruptive

Abstract = {Hedge funds have become active in corporate governance. They push for
   changes in strategy and the adoption of specific business plans. Their
   tactics include buying shares, conducting public campaigns, lobbying
   managers and other shareholders, seeking representation on the board of
   directors, and sometimes running a proxy contest. In response, boards
   have adopted a variety of ``defensive measures,{''} including deploying
   ``poison pill{''} shareholder rights plans against activists.
   This Article provides a comprehensive policy and doctrinal analysis of
   the use of poison pills against activists in corporate governance
   contests (as distinguished from corporate control contests). We argue
   that, because of the significance of the specific design features
   features that have so far received little judicial attention it is
   increasingly important to scrutinize pills to assure that they are
   targeted to address legitimate objectives. Various design features of a
   pill interact, and features that may be harmless in pills designed to
   fend off a hostile takeover are unjustifiable in pills employed against
   an activist hedge fund. While a board acting in good faith should be
   permitted to use a pill to enhance the shareholder decision-making
   process, it should, in doing so, act as a ``neutral election board{''}.},

Abstract = {Corporate law largely addresses three basic relationships: shareholder
   versus manager, shareholder versus non-equity investor, and majority
   shareholder versus minority shareholder. Ever since the pioneering work
   of Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means, a great deal of scholarly attention
   has been directed toward the first relationship. The second relationship
   earned its share of the limelight with the leveraged buyout trend of the
   1980s. It is only in this decade, however, that the third relationship
   has taken center stage-in the wake of several incongruous Delaware cases
   and a flood of post-Sarbanes-Oxley freezeout mergers.
   This scrutiny is certainly warranted, as the tension between majority
   and minority shareholders presents thorny concerns and has the potential
   to erode considerable social welfare. In essence, lawmakers must walk a
   tightrope between two alternative hazards. On the one hand, assigning
   too much power to minority shareholders can lead to a holdout problem
   where recalcitrant dissenters demand private tribute before blessing a
   decision (such as a merger). On the other hand, granting the majority
   untrammeled discretion to freeze out minority owners can promote
   tunneling or other abuses of power that will depress the ex ante value
   of a firm. Thus far, the law has addressed these concerns with
   disclosure obligations, special committees, judicial review of fiduciary
   duties, and appraisal rights. But the results are far from satisfying.
   This Article offers a novel idea for governing the tension between
   majority and minority shareholders: an ``internal poison pill.{''}
   Borrowing conceptually from the famous shareholder rights plans created
   in the 1980s to address bullying external bidders, I show how an
   analogous (though economically distinct) financial instrument might be
   used by shareholders to navigate the twin internal governance tensions
   of holdout and expropriation. Two key features of this proposal
   distinguish it from alternative reforms: (1) It focuses on a privately
   enacted solution with room for contextual customization; and (2) it uses
   embedded option theory to construct an intermediate legal entitlement
   (as opposed to an extreme property or liability rule) for both majority
   and minority shareholders. If successfully scoped and swallowed, these
   internal poison pills could facilitate efficient freezeouts, chill
   coercive ones, supplant the awkward remedy of appraisal, and,
   ultimately, increase the ex ante value of firms by mitigating agency
   problems between majority and minority shareholders.},

   Defensive share repurchases slightly reduce the takeover likelihood but
   do not appear to harm shareholders, perhaps because they tend to fend

Abstract = {Exploiting a hand-collected database with almost 2,200 firms during

   pills and firm value. Consistent with earlier results, I document a
   strong negative association between pills and firm value
   cross-sectionally and within firm. However, I document that all the
   within-firm association is driven by pill adoptions (and none by the
   dropping of pills), all the drop in value associated with adoptions
   precedes the pills' adoption, and firms adopted their pills after
   experiencing drops in their operating performance. These results
   indicate that the ostensive negative effect of pills on firm value is
   due to a spurious correlation and that prior analyses were incorrect in
   concluding that pill adoptions are harmful and indicative of bad
   governance. Moreover, the results question the usefulness of the
   dramatic drop in the incidence of pills that took place during the last
   decade.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of stock
   price crash risk on the adoption of poison pills.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors estimate logit and probit
   regressions. Their sample includes 185 Brazilian public firms for the
   period 2010-2018. Following previous studies, the authors use the
   negative skewness of firm-specific weekly returns and the down-to-up
   volatility of firm-specific weekly returns as measures of firm's stock
   price crash risk. As proxies of poison pills, the authors employ the
   ``conventional{''} poison pills in their baseline models and the
   ``eternity{''} poison pills, which prevent the removal of poison pills
   from bylaws, in additional models. Findings The authors find that stock
   price crash risk measures are not associated with poison pill adoption.
   However, although stock price crash risk does not lead to poison pill
   adoption as a complementary corporate governance mechanism that protects
   firms against hostile takeover attempts, further results show that
   managers do not draw on stock price crash risk as a pretext to entrench
   themselves. Additional analyses also highlight that CEO power seems to
   play a role in moderating the relationship between stock price crash
   risk and eternity poison pill adoption. Originality/value The authors
   contribute to the literature on stock price crash risk, which calls for
   research in international contexts to better understand the effect of
   stock price crash risk on country-specific idiosyncratic features. The
   authors discuss a controversial anti-takeover mechanism that has been
   debated by Brazilian policymakers.},

Abstract = {The recent economic downturn resulted in firms generating significant
   tax losses, which they risked losing if they experienced an ownership
   change. In response, a number of loss firms adopted poison pill plans.
   We document a significant negative market reaction to the announcement
   of 62 poison pill adoptions related to net operating losses (NOLs),
   suggesting that in general investors do not consider management's claim
   that the pills are adopted to preserve a valuable tax asset to be
   credible. However, we find cross-sectional variation consistent with
   investors considering whether a pill is legitimately adopted to preserve
   the NOL or to entrench management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {62},
Number = {4},
Pages = {307-330},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {We find that units are more likely to adopt poison pills at the time of
   a spinoff if their parents have anti-takeover provisions in place. In
   addition, the probability that a spinoff unit adopts a poison pill is
   negatively related to outside block ownership, but positively related to
   the size of the unit, institutional ownership, industry takeover
   activities, and relative industry market-to-book ratio. Units that
   adopted poison pills elicit a strong negative market response at the
   time of the spinoff, which implies that investors may believe the pills
   could prevent the units from being acquired. Despite the initial
   negative market response, abnormal long-run returns are higher among
   units that implement poison pills before the spinoff is executed than
   among units that do not. Moreover, we find that the units' adoption of
   poison pills does not reduce their likelihood of being acquired, which
   suggests that the pills may be intended to increase bargaining power
   rather than prevent takeovers, and could explain the more favorable
   long-run abnormal returns. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   unless the board reasonably believes that leaving them in place will
   engender a higher bid. Additionally, the author asserts that

   Poison Pill Adoption},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {44},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1953-1979},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Signaling theory suggests that firms send signals to stakeholders to
   reduce information asymmetry. Research, however, has rarely examined how
   investors interpret signals that are equivocal. We suggest that
   sensemaking serves as an important process by which investors interpret
   firm signals, and salient contextual cues influence the sensemaking
   process. We examine an equivocal signal, the adoption of a poison pill,
   as a means of examining investor interpretation of the signal and the
   role of contextual cues in influencing interpretation. Using a sample of
   578 poison pill adoptions and controlling for self-selection, we find
   that investors react negatively to poison pills adopted to protect net
   operating losses (NOL poison pills) but positively to poison pills
   adopted when the firm is in receipt of a takeover offer (in-play poison
   pills). Assessing the role of contextual cues, our results suggest that
   CEO duality, the proportion of inside directors on the firm's board, the
   firm's R\&D investments, and industry concentration also condition
   investor response to specific-purpose poison pill adoption. Our study
   contributes to research on signaling theory, sensemaking, and corporate
   governance by examining how investors interpret a firm's equivocal

   issues. This paper provides evidence that staggered boards impede R\&D
   investments. In contrast we show that unequal voting rights and poison
   pill provisions have no significant effect on long term R\&D
   investments. We also find that a combination of a staggered board and a
   poison pill provision discourages innovation investments. This study
   uncovers an economic mechanism on the differential effects of
   antitakeover provisions on R\&D responsiveness to firm investment sets.
   Staggered boards decrease the sensitivity of R\&D to the investment
   opportunity set, resulting to higher innovative inefficiency. The
   managerial moral hazard effect of staggered boards disproportionately
   contributes to low firm performance in innovative firms. This study
   provides evidence on the source of the efficiency loss from staggered
   boards by pointing to its governance role in promoting more inefficient
   allocation of R\&D capital. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Controversial `Poison Pill' Takeover Defense: How valid are the
   Arguments in Support of it?},
Journal = {NMIMS MANAGEMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Pages = {47-66},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In today's world of business, Mergers and Acquisitions (M\&A) are an
   indispensable part of corporate strategy. However, not all mergers and
   acquisitions are friendly and the threat of hostile takeovers has led to
   the development of a wide range of anti-takeover defenses. This paper
   looks at one of the most controversial takeover defenses, the `poison
   pill'. This assumes significance in light of the fact that M\&As,
   including hostile takeovers, are not merely a North American phenomena
   and defensive tactics used in this region are spreading to other
   regions. This paper examines the merits of various arguments used in
   support of the poison pill taking into consideration previous research
   on takeover defenses. It finds that poison pills have a strong deterrent
   effect on takeovers and the bargaining power argument does not provide
   sufficient economic rationale for shareholders to leave the decision to
   the board. The paper concludes that the use of a poison pill without a
   provision for shareholders review, particularly when combined with an
   effective staggered board, strongly suggests that management
   entrenchment and shareholder activism in this direction is a natural
   consequence. The paper recommends design of takeover defenses that align
   the interests of both shareholders and management.},

   provisions should not be seen as a detriment to firms' financial

   such as the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), our findings
   revealed that there are three configurations of governance provisions
   that lead to superior financial performance. The presence of poison
   pills appeared as a core condition in all solutions. Negated analysis
   indicates that the inappropriate bundling of governance provisions leads
   to poor firm performance.},

Abstract = {There has been rapid growth in the study of diffusion across

   attention to why practices diffuse at different rates and via different

   are proposed: broader comparative research designs, closer inspection of
   the content of social relations between collective actors, and more
   attention to diffusion industries run by the media and communities of

Title = {KEEPING SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM ALIVE: A COMPARATIVE APPROACH TO OUTLAWING
   DEAD HAND PROXY PUTS IN DELAWARE},
Journal = {FORDHAM LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {84},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Current trends in shareholder activism have brought to light the
   competing interests of management and stockholders. With a rise in
   shareholder activism, firms are continuing to include change in control
   provisions, known as proxy puts, in their debt agreements to counter
   activist success. Recent litigation regarding the use of these
   provisions has created a debate as to whether these provisions are valid
   under Delaware law. Moreover, companies and lending institutions have
   morphed these provisions into a more restrictive form, known as ``dead
   hand proxy puts.{''} The controversy analyzed in this Note arises out of
   the use of dead hand proxy puts in debt agreements.
   The Delaware Chancery Court has considered the issue of proxy puts in
   three recent cases. On no occasion has the court declared traditional or
   dead hand proxy puts invalid; the court, however, expressed skepticism
   toward these provisions. With a recognized entrenchment effect on
   management and a deterrent effect on the stockholder franchise, the
   court indicated that they could potentially be invalid in Delaware as a
   matter of public policy.
   This Note considers the rise of shareholder activism in the United
   States and the use of both proxy puts and poison pills to defend against
   activist investors and hostile takeovers. It analyzes the current debate
   over dead hand proxy puts and compares these provisions to the already
   illegal dead hand poison pills. It ultimately argues that dead hand
   proxy puts should be outlawed in Delaware on the same basis as dead hand
   poison pills.},

Title = {The endogeneity of poison pill adoption and unsolicited takeovers},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL FINANCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-36},
Abstract = {Purpose - Poison pill adoption is often considered as the most effective
   tactic to fend off an unsolicited takeover bid. However, it is difficult
   to identify the deterrent effect because the adoption is naturally
   endogenous. The purpose of this paper is to use plausibly exogenous
   instruments to mitigate the endogeneity problem.
   Design/methodology/approach - The author employs two econometric models:
   the linear probability model and the bivariate probit model to examine
   the effect of poison pills on the outcome of a takeover.
   Findings - Using a sample of 655 unsolicited takeovers, the author finds
   that poison pills substantially reduce the likelihood that a takeover
   bid, once undesirably placed, is completed. This negative impact
   strongly supports the manager entrenchment hypothesis in that managers
   adopt poison pills to ensure the continuation of their private benefits.
   However, the author finds no strong evidence consistent with the
   shareholder interest hypothesis that poison pills enhance the
   management's ability to negotiate higher premiums or reject inadequate
   offers.
   Research limitations/implications - The demise of the market for
   unsolicited takeovers with the disappearance of poison pills can be
   explained by the fact that poison pills, if adopted, will have an
   absolute deterrent effect on the takeover likelihood of success, and
   targets always have the power to adopt them instantly.
   Practical implications - There should be policies to limit the power of
   managers to adopt poison pills because it causes the entrenchment
   problem which will negatively affect the firm value.
   Originality/value - The author tackles the problem of the endogeneity of
   poison pill adoptions. The author shows that poison pills have a strong
   negative effect on the takeover outcome and the result can explain the
   decreasing number of unsolicited takeovers.},

Abstract = {A significant amount of research has examined firms' decisions to adopt
   poison pills; however, firms today are increasingly repealing or
   allowing poison pills to expire. Based on agency theory, the authors
   examine competing perspectives of governance mechanisms as having
   complementary or substitutive effects within the context of poison pill
   repeal. They test whether firms repeal poison pills when governance is
   strong (complementary effects) or allow for other governance mechanisms
   to compensate for potential agency costs associated with poison pill
   renewal (substitutive effects). Using a sample of 288 firms who made
   decisions to terminate or renew poison pills, the authors find that
   firms with CEO duality, fewer directors nominated by the CEO, and higher
   levels of outside director ownership and pressure-resistant
   institutional shareholdings are more likely to repeal poison pills. A
   curvilinear relationship between managerial ownership and poison pill
   repeal is also found. The results provide greater support for the notion
   that firms use governance mechanisms as complements rather than
   substitutes.},

Abstract = {This paper tests a theory conjecturing that cross-listing can insulate
   firms from potential hostile takeovers owing to the increased cost

   the corporate control threat and the likelihood that firms cross list in
   a foreign country. Firms facing takeover threats are more likely to
   choose hosting countries with greater accounting differences from the US
   GAAP. Subsample evidence suggests that cross-listing is more likely to
   be used as an antitakeover device if firms have foreign market exposure
   or when all-cash offers are less likely. Tests based on quasi-natural

Journal = {NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {106},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {927-949},
Abstract = {The Internal Revenue Service's net operating loss rules enable
   corporations to use one year's losses to offset their tax liability in
   future years. However, a corporation's ability to do so depends on its
   maintaining the same ownership: if enough of a corporation's stock
   changes hands, it loses the ability to take advantage of all of its
   prior losses. In response to the threat of ownership changes,
   corporations have enacted particularly strict ``poison pills,{''} which
   are designed to prevent stock from changing hands. However, a side
   effect of these poison pills is that they ameliorate the threat of
   hostile takeovers, thereby reducing managers' incentives to maximize
   corporate welfare. In this Comment, I suggest using the appraisal
   mechanism to alleviate the need for poison pills and ownership-change
   restrictions by enabling corporations to pursue damages against
   shareholders who trigger the devaluing of their net operating losses.
   The proposed appraisal regime properly balances the interests of tax law
   and corporate law by ensuring that net operating losses will not be
   freely transferred but will also not serve as an excuse for allowing
   managerial incentives to deviate from the proper goal of shareholder
   wealth maximization.},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Pages = {6-24},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the role of large
   equity ownership by both institutions and outside block shareholders in
   monitoring the board of directors' decision to initially adopt defense
   mechanisms and the subsequent capital market reaction to the adoption.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper employs an empirical
   methodology that controls for selection bias. Multiple regressions were
   employed to assess the relationship among the variables.
   Findings - Stockholder wealth effects of poison pills are positively
   related to pressure-resistant institutions, which is consistent with
   effective monitoring. The wealth effects of poison pills, however, are
   negatively related to pressure-sensitive investors, consistent with
   passivity. No empirical relation was found between ownership structure
   and shareholder approved amendments such as classified boards and fair
   price amendments.
   Research limitations/implications - This study was conducted as a large
   sample analysis over an earlier time period that was more applicable for
   evaluating anti-takeover techniques.
   Practical implications - The results are consistent with
   pressure-resistant institutions actively monitoring to prevent
   unilaterally implemented defense mechanisms of all types, whereas
   pressuresensitive institutions appear to more readily accept poison
   pills.
   Originality/value - These results suggest that failing to control for

   premiums when the target employs a top-tier advisor and the acquisition
   is initiated by the acquirer. These results support the argument that
   top-tier target advisors might be more effective in utilizing takeover

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper examines the link between firm performance, CEO
   characteristics and changes in corporate governance practices using an
   unbalanced panel of 1721 firms from 1980 to 1995. This paper provides
   the stylized facts about corporate governance practices and details how
   governance practices have evolved over time. By 1995, the majority of
   firms had implemented differing types of charter amendments, poison
   pills or other governance provisions that are potentially harmful to
   shareholders. Most firms have adopted multiple and even redundant
   governance provisions. Shareholders are more likely to approve an
   increase in the power of the boards of directors of better performing

Title = {Japanese corporate governance practices in the post-bubble era:
   Implications of institutional and legal reforms in the 1990s and early

Abstract = {The burst of the financial bubble in 1990 triggered a long recession in
   Japan. Ensuing massive bad loan problems plagued Japanese banks, many of
   which faced bankruptcy. Japanese firms also suffered from the massive
   excess capacity that their banks' bad loans financed. Japanese firms no
   longer had access to the traditional bank financing from their failing
   banks and were unable to renew their dated production equipment. They
   lost global competitiveness in the globalising era. Facing public
   criticisms blaming Japan's bank-based corporate governance practices for
   the problems Japan was facing, the Japanese government undertook a major
   overhaul of almost all aspects of Japan's legal settings for corporate
   governance. In response to the legal reforms many Japanese firms began
   changing their corporate governance and other business practices.
   Many of the changes that have been proposed or implemented in the 1990s
   and the 2000s are intended to transform many of Japan's corporate
   governance practices from insider-oriented keiretsu and bank-based
   practices to more transparent market driven practices.
   These changes are modelled after the US practices. How much of such US
   practices will be adopted in the end by Japanese firms is still unknown.
   This paper discusses some of the key changes in Japan's corporate
   governance laws and their implications for corporate governance
   practices. Particular attention is paid to the impacts of the recent
   legal changes on M\&A activities and also the changing role of Japanese
   keiretsu.},

Title = {TOWARD A CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OF THE POISON PILL},
Journal = {COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW},

Number = {6},
Pages = {1549-1593},

Abstract = {We argue that the state-law rules governing poison pills are vulnerable
   to challenges based on preemption by the Williams Act. Such challenges,
   we show, could well have a major impact on the corporate-law landscape.
   The Williams Act established a federal regime regulating unsolicited
   tender offers, but states subsequently developed a body of state
   antitakeover laws that impose additional impediments to such offers. In
   a series of well-known cases during the 1970s and 1980s, the federal
   courts, including the Supreme Court, held some of these state
   antitakeover laws preempted by the Williams Act. To date, however,
   federal courts and commentators have paid little attention to the
   possibility that the state-law rules authorizing the use of poison
   pills-the most powerful impediment to outside buyers of shares-are also
   preempted.
   Our study examines this subject and concludes that there is a
   substantial basis for questioning the continued validity of current
   state-law rules authorizing the use of poison pills. The Essay shows
   that these rules now impose tighter restrictions on unsolicited offers
   than those once imposed by state antitakeover regulations that the
   federal courts invalidated on preemption grounds. Preemption challenges
   to these poison-pill rules could well result in their invalidation by
   the federal courts.
   Finally, we discuss how state lawmakers could revise poison-pill rules
   to make them more likely to survive a federal preemption challenge. This
   could be done, we show, by imposing substantial limits on the length of
   time during which a poison pill can be used to block tender offers.
   Whether preemption challenges lead to invalidation of existing
   poison-pill state rules or to their substantial modification, such
   challenges could well reshape the market for corporate control.},

Title = {Takeover defenses and wealth effects on security holders: The case of

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BANKING \& FINANCE},
Year = {1996},
Volume = {20},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1231-1250},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This is the first study to examine the valuation effects of any
   antitakeover amendment on both bondholders and stockholders. We present
   new evidence documenting that, on average, there is a significant wealth
   loss experienced by bondholders at poison pill adoption announcement,
   while stockholders are unaffected. Our finding of significant bondholder
   losses is consistent with the proposed negative signal hypothesis. We
   document results which indicate that bondholders correctly anticipate
   the degree of leverage increase at the time of the announcement. We also
   show that the proportion of insider ownership is negatively related to
   bondholder wealth effect at announcement. This supports the notion that
   higher insider (manager) ownership leads to a greater alignment of
   manager-stockholder interests while increasing the
   stockholder-bondholder agency costs. Long-run analysis of leverage and
   performance measures reveal that pill adopting firms are not
   under-leveraged as compared to their industry rivals. However,
   supporting the negative signal hypothesis, the leverage of sample firms
   rises significantly after the pill adoption. Performance measures reveal
   that sample firms significantly underperform their industry cohorts.
   This result suggests that poison pill adoptions are motivated by poor
   managers attempting to immunize themselves from the disciplinary actions
   of the corporate control market.},
